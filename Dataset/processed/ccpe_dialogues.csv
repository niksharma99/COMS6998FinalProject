CCPE-8e113,4,USER,"Zodiac the movie about a serial killer from the '60s or '70s, around there."
CCPE-8e113,5,ASSISTANT,"Zodiac? oh wow ok, what do you like about that movie"
CCPE-8e113,6,USER,"And I just think serial killers, in general, are interesting, so the movie was really good. And it was just neat to see that world. Like it went really in-depth. It was like almost 3 hours long, so you got to really feel like you were a part of that world and time period. And see what the detectives and the police did and the investigators."
CCPE-8e113,7,ASSISTANT,so you feel like you were part of that world ?
CCPE-8e113,8,USER,Yeah. It was really an immersive movie.
CCPE-8e113,9,ASSISTANT,if you were in the movie what character do you feel most relatable
CCPE-8e113,10,USER,"Probably the main character, Robert Graysmith, just cuz he's awkward and bumbly. So, I guess that's the one I would be the closest to."
CCPE-8e113,11,ASSISTANT,what scene do you like the best
CCPE-8e113,12,USER,Probably the most memorable one is the murder at the lake. Just cuz it's really vivid and horrific to watch. But it's very memorable.

CCPE-8e113,19,ASSISTANT,would you be interested to watch it
CCPE-8e113,20,USER,"Not particularly. I don't really like comic book movies that much. But I really wanted to see Deadpool, so I'd probably be more willing to watch that than most comic book movies."
CCPE-8e113,21,ASSISTANT,oh what makes deadpool different than the others?
CCPE-8e113,22,USER,"I don't know. It just seems a unique concept and different, not just the standard superhero movie."
CCPE-8e113,23,USER,"And it's more of a comedy, so that's unique."
CCPE-8e113,24,ASSISTANT,"ok so you enjoy comedy as well, correct?"
CCPE-8e113,25,USER,"Yep, I think most people do."
CCPE-8e113,26,ASSISTANT,what type of movie you don't enjoy?
CCPE-8e113,27,USER,"I'm not a big action movie fan like Die Hard or like Rambo movies. I don't hate them, I just think they're boring. Like I can't watch a lot of them, or else I get sick of them."
CCPE-8e113,28,ASSISTANT,what about mission impossible?
CCPE-8e113,29,USER,"Never seen it. I know what it is, but I haven't seen it."
CCPE-8e113,30,ASSISTANT,do you care who acts in the movie?
CCPE-8e113,31,USER,Just in general? I'm not I'm not picky about actors. Like I won't see a movie just cuz I don't like the actor in it.
CCPE-8e113,32,ASSISTANT,oh ok so you dont have a favorite actor is that right
CCPE-8e113,33,USER,"I mean I like certain actors more than others, but I wouldn't say I have a favorite actor."

It seemed to be lacking in finesse and It just seemed very over the top. It really did seem like an event movie, and maybe if I had seen it in the theater, I would have sort of fallen in love with it like other people did, but"
CCPE-fc882,16,USER,It just It was underwhelming. The direction wasn't nearly as good as I thought it was going to be and I just thought it was going to be something more exciting and more appealing that it ended up being for me.

I just don't enjoy scaring myself like that. So, the first Halloween the one that originally has Jamie Curtis from back in the day, that is a much better movie than the other Halloweens were. But, I still They are still not my favorite. Too scary."
CCPE-fc882,23,USER,"and outside of the first one. And apparently I ha I haven't seen up the most recent one that is sort of a direct sequel to the first one. Those That is a lot of gore, a lot of blood, a lot of trying to scare and not a lot of story line in movie."

CCPE-22ad5,2,ASSISTANT,Is there a specific reason why?

CCPE-1067f,16,USER,"Kind of blah. If If You know, if there was a really good smart one that came out, I'd probably watch it, but I generally just avoid car movies altogether cuz they're just too It's like watching the same movie over and over again."

There are moments that are completely touching, which is amazing cuz you're watching something in a prison"
CCPE-10c35,11,USER,"then make a reading for the characters, if you there there really is a delineation between good and evil despite being in a prison. It's just that it's a phenomenal movie and the acting, and the writing, and the direction are top notch."

And it was just it was definitely fun the these are getting harder to come by at this point. They used to make them so much more often. So, when you find a good one like this it's it's a rare gem."

And he kills almost everybody in his movies, so that's why I'm not really a fan. A Walk to Remember has The lead dies, so it's Even though it's a teen movie, it's very sad. It's a drama"
CCPE-e213d,19,USER,"not a comedy, and she's sick. She's sick throughout the entire movie. There is sort of a nice, endearing teen love story, and you do get involved with the character, but she has cancer. She's dying, and she does die in the movie. And it's It's kind of heavy, so it's not really It's not fun. I can like these movies, but"

Very talented cast. And despite it being a different culture, one we don't typically get to see as much"

They're also They don't tend to be realistic, so they don't remind you of anything about everyday life, so it's a good escape, and usually an exciting one that you can really ride out and you know, and watch and be engaged for 2 hours."
CCPE-51799,4,ASSISTANT,The adrenaline rush from these movies definitely draws people in
CCPE-51799,5,USER,Exactly.
CCPE-51799,6,ASSISTANT,Is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?

CCPE-51799,8,ASSISTANT,What did you like about this movie?
CCPE-51799,9,USER,"that has an ensemble cast that really works. It's clever we don't have a ton or at the time we didn't have a ton of action movies that were based around cars and car chases. So, it was a little different. And so the action was a little bit different and it was sort it was exciting to watch the car chases. So, it really worked. And it was it was pretty well written."
CCPE-51799,10,USER,"I mean the acting was excellent, and the writing was pretty good, so it was it was enjoyable action film but also one that was not as familiar as they had been making at that point. We had way more in recent years but at that time it was fairly original."
CCPE-51799,11,ASSISTANT,A cast can definitely factor into a movie's success and a great story definitely needs to be there too

CCPE-51799,16,USER,"I'm not really a fan of scaring myself while watching a film. I like to just be able to enjoy it. And for the most part, a scary movie will literally scare me, possibly cause nightmares, so it's not something that I typically go into enjoying. It's something I go into with trepidation. So it sort of defeats the purpose. I I consider movies an enjoyment, so it really does defeat the purpose for me to be watching a scary movie."
CCPE-51799,17,ASSISTANT,Is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?
CCPE-51799,18,ASSISTANT,What do you dislike about this movie?
CCPE-51799,19,USER,"So Olympus has Fallen is a action film that is around the white house that's not particularly good and it takes itself way too seriously. So even if it was decent enough it's not realistic enough for it to be taken as seriously as it was taking itself. So, it doesn't really work. I I completely confused the cast. The supporting cast is better than the leaders."
CCPE-51799,20,ASSISTANT,Have you seen Black Panther?
CCPE-51799,21,USER,I have.
CCPE-51799,22,ASSISTANT,What did you like or dislike about this title?

So it was refreshing. It was great to see. It was inspiring to see, and the movie was actually great. It wasn't even like it was some sort of a downgrade. It was an upgrade for superhero movies."
CCPE-51799,24,USER,"So, the the acting is fantastic, the story line fantastic, it was all around excellent movie."

CCPE-7b258,13,USER,"Probably the weakest storyline, the one that doesn't use the sort of lead character of the series, John McClane, which is played by Bruce Willis well. It had good action. That was basically all it had going for it, but even then, it just It just wasn't great. It was I think the wrong setting. I think a lot of A lot of bad choices for that movie."

CCPE-58bf2,16,USER,"That's right. I like The Beatles music but not in a movie form. I think it's just repetition of it. It gets tiresome. Like if there's one song or two songs in the movie, maybe I can that's fine. But when it's like every 5-10 minutes or whatever, it breaks down to it gets tiresome. But I also don't like to listen to the same type of music. Like I don't listen"

Though you don't see it too often. But it it was the It was that Tarantino mix of like ultra-violence, unpredictability, great dialog, and you just never"

CCPE-de4ff,9,USER,"Sure. It is an epic film, and to me, it doesn't do well with its epicness. It is rather ordinary, and the two main characters, while likable, would have been better suited for something of a smaller scale, despite the overall grand nature of the story they were trying to tell in the historical aspect. And the other thing is that it just"
CCPE-de4ff,10,USER,"It's It's so such a over hyped movie and it's just, I don't know, ordinary. It's not something that's overly enjoyable and it's nothing that you want to keep watching over and over again.

CCPE-de4ff,25,USER,"Sure. It is Star Wars mythology and the world that they create is really something special, and this definitely continues that. The other thing is that it's just It's quite a world that they've created, so it's exciting.

So, I like lighter, funnier comedies, and romantic comedies are my favorite kind of"

CCPE-99f42,7,USER,"Sure. So like Love Adores is a easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. It is It has actually a very good cast, but the script and whatever they are trying to do in a movie is so flawed. That one is an approach where they have two women who are sort of friends and they are traveling together and they're"
CCPE-99f42,8,USER,"embarking on sort of a new part of their life, but to say it doesn't work is an understatement. It's It's very bizarre. It sort of starts as like a romantic comedy and turns into a bit of a thriller, which It's based on a book, and I never read the book, so I don't think that's how the book turns out, but it's completely unexpected and not how they sold the movie. And So that was bad writing, really bad directing, and just a bad idea in general, despite having"

CCPE-99f42,15,USER,"That's more like a teen movie, another favorite genre of mine. I love teen movies. They are sort of like They actually are almost, in many ways, either a mini comedy or a mini romantic comedy. Except, because they're teen-focused, they are even more simplistic, because they, you know, they're young, they only have so many things going on, you know, it'll be it's like sort of, you know, their problems are limited to"
CCPE-99f42,16,USER,"Mostly boys' school, girls', maybe getting into college, that kind of thing. But, they don't have a a ton of real life problems going on. So, it's pretty simple. And So But, there's still a lot you can do. And it's good for the audience because we all had to go through that time, so it's something easy to look back and laugh on. But, yeah. In the movie in particular, unknown to me, the girl who stars in it was really good. And really the"

CCPE-3fd23,3,USER,I like their plot. I like the romance in them.
CCPE-3fd23,4,USER,"You know, it's interesting you should ask that, because I I really do enjoy the drama films. And they go back to like the core of acting too, like there's not a whole lot of like action in there. Like I really liked About Schmidt. I don't know if you could call that a drama film, but there's a lot of drama in that film."
CCPE-3fd23,5,ASSISTANT,so aside from the drama what else did you like about that movie
CCPE-3fd23,6,USER,The deadpan acting from the lead character is really funny.
CCPE-3fd23,7,USER,"Well, the film is a lot funnier than people like actually think it is. Some of it Some of it did get a little like over the top like the guy the like before the wedding he took like a ton of prescription pills and like that's not realistic. But it was really really funny."
CCPE-3fd23,8,ASSISTANT,Can you name me a movie you didn't like?

CCPE-3fd23,10,USER,"Jeez, The Bye Bye Man I really didn't like."
CCPE-3fd23,11,USER,"Just such a stupid idea. I heard one of my co-workers say like, oh, it's a bad film. It's a bad film. It's a really pathetically named film. It's really awful. I'm like, all right, I should go see it. Then. Of course I go see it and it turns out to be absolutely a hot pile of garbage."

CCPE-3fd23,21,ASSISTANT,how was that?
CCPE-3fd23,22,USER,"That was a really good movie. That was a piece on when the Japanese invaded I think Indonesia back in the '40s or '50s like during World War II. It follows this guy who like finds this Buddhist monk and they play the harp. There is no real harp in it, but they do sing like Home Sweet Home. It's a period piece, it's really gorgeously done. I thought it was really good. It's dubbed in English. It's not dubbed like it has subtitles in English. I think it's spoken in Japanese."
CCPE-3fd23,23,ASSISTANT,what did you think of the ending?
CCPE-3fd23,24,USER,"The ending, oh, the ending was was really good. Like, I think he goes home. I don't think there's like a love interest in the story per se. It's about war, you know, it's about war. And he goes on this beach once. I think it ends it ends on a ship with his like wise Buddhist giving a statement of like He might be reading, no, he's reading he's reading the guys that he's reading the protagonist letter as all the Japanese troops on the ship go home."

CCPE-36f28,34,USER,"They were like like the new Spider-Man: Homecoming I think with the the kind of I don't know. It was cheesy. It wasn't like more serious, like even the first The second one with Andrew Garfield was pretty good."

CCPE-15477,0,ASSISTANT,"What kind of movies to you like, and why do you like this type of movie?"
CCPE-15477,1,USER,"I like action movies. They are sort of exciting, usually fun and really quite an escape from, you know, your real life. It's usually not something you are going to be encountering. So it's really an experience you are not going to be you can really embrace yourself and and not think, ""Oh, this is real life and it's about to happen."" So it's it could be a lot of fun, very exciting"
CCPE-15477,2,USER,And sort of a real thing you can immerse yourself in for a few hours.
CCPE-15477,3,ASSISTANT,Can you name a particular movie that you like?
CCPE-15477,4,USER,Sure. I love Bourne Ultimatum.
CCPE-15477,5,ASSISTANT,Can you give me a couple of reasons why you like this movie?
CCPE-15477,6,USER,"Sure. Bourne Ultimatum is a excellent movie on literally every front. It is a excellent acting, excellent writing, excellent direction. The direction is usually overlooked but the directing is phenomenal and it helps make the movie absolutely perfect. It is a very tight movie. There is barely a a a second that is wasted."
CCPE-15477,7,USER,"and I don't know. Let's say the movie is like 2 hours or 2 hours and 20 minutes or something. It feels like it goes by so quickly because it's just It has such a rhythm to it, and you're just immersed and involved with what's going on. And it's a character you can root for, and just people you like And this is a continuing series, so you really know the character already, and you're really there to root them on."
CCPE-15477,8,ASSISTANT,Can you name a movie that you do not like?
CCPE-15477,9,USER,"Yes, unlike so many I did not like Dark Knight."
CCPE-15477,10,ASSISTANT,What do you dislike about this movie? Please give me 2 reasons.
CCPE-15477,11,USER,"Sure, Dark Knight is a Batman movie, and Batman already had an original, and it's so the problem of Dark Knight for me is is not true to the comic, and we saw a movie that was great and true to the comic. So, I don't like the joker character, it's not that bad. Keith Ledger was bad as the joker necessarily, not exactly, it's that it was not written very poorly. It was so dark."
CCPE-15477,12,USER,So the two things I really don't like are it wasn't funny which is what the joke was supposed to be and the writing was extremely disappointing and very dark so just it was a a just bad all around for me.
CCPE-15477,13,ASSISTANT,Do you like the movie Guardians of the Galaxy?
CCPE-15477,14,USER,"That's not a movie I have seen, but it's the kind of movie that I would like, that's a superhero movie."

CCPE-15477,18,USER,"Sure. I don't like horror movies, so I don't like scary things, and I don't like sort of things that are meant to just sort of scare and gross you out, which is what The Purge is trying to do."
CCPE-15477,19,ASSISTANT,"Do you like the movie It's Christmas, Eve?"
CCPE-15477,20,USER,I'm not sure I know that movie.
CCPE-15477,21,ASSISTANT,Have you heard of this movie?
CCPE-15477,22,USER,I don't think so.
CCPE-15477,23,ASSISTANT,Would you go see it?

CCPE-15477,26,USER,"I like the Nutcracker. I'm not sure what the Four Realms is. I was at the new one. Yes, that would be something that I would see."
CCPE-15477,27,ASSISTANT,Do you like the movie Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ?

CCPE-15477,29,ASSISTANT,Why do you dislike this movie? Please give 2 reasons.

CCPE-0cd98,1,USER,"I like the really like the thrillers, you know, stuff like Memento or you know, something that's got some twists and turns in it. Maybe it makes you think it's going to end one way and then ends the other. I like The Sixth Sense or that Gone Girl was pretty good, even though it was kind of"
CCPE-0cd98,2,USER,"It was kind of easy to tell it was going, but it was still still pretty good. Also trying to think of another one."
CCPE-0cd98,3,ASSISTANT,Is there a particular film you enjoy?
CCPE-0cd98,4,USER,"Yeah, The Usual Suspects, because Mainly because I really When I watched it the first time, it's one of those movies that you can't really I mean, you can watch it more than once, but you The first time you watch, you won't know the twist, so it really kind of grabs you. And with that one, I really didn't have any clue. I mean, usually you might have some kind of inkling of what's going to happen, but with that movie to me, it just really kind of grabbed me, and I was like, man"
CCPE-0cd98,5,USER,It left me kind of speechless at the end.
CCPE-0cd98,6,ASSISTANT,What did you like about that film?
CCPE-0cd98,7,USER,"I liked that I didn't I couldn't predict the ending of it. You know, like I said just a second ago. You know, it was really a unique movie, and you know, just had a a great ending that you really just did not expect at all."
CCPE-0cd98,8,ASSISTANT,Is there a particular movie you don't enjoy?
CCPE-0cd98,9,USER,"I wasn't a huge fan of the Harry Porter movies. It's not that I didn't enjoy them so much, it's just, I don't know, I just wasn't I never read the books I guess I just wasn't as interested in them as everybody else. I actually"
CCPE-0cd98,10,USER,I don't think I've seen all of them to be honest. I never watched the first couple.
CCPE-0cd98,11,ASSISTANT,What didn't you like about those films?
CCPE-0cd98,12,USER,"Oh. I don't know. It's nothing really particularly You know, not any one particular thing. To me, they were just kind of boring and I don't know. I mean I It's odd because I generally like those kinds of types of things, but to me something I guess maybe if I would have read the books as a kid, then I would probably you know like it more. But it just wasn't all that interesting to me."
CCPE-0cd98,13,ASSISTANT,Have you heard about the movie Get Out?
CCPE-0cd98,14,USER,"Yeah, I actually haven't seen it. I'm not a big horror movie kind of guy, either. But I heard it was good. I probably will watch it. Like I said"
CCPE-0cd98,15,ASSISTANT,Would you go see the movie Get Out?
CCPE-0cd98,16,USER,"I might Netflix it. I didn't go see it when it was out, or I don't know. You know, now that you're saying it, maybe I should go to the box and rent it tonight, cuz I'm pretty sure it's up there. But I had heard it was good. It just didn't"
CCPE-0cd98,17,USER,"It's just not my kind of thing, really."
CCPE-0cd98,18,ASSISTANT,Did you see the movie the movie Overlord?
CCPE-0cd98,19,USER,Is that the one
CCPE-0cd98,20,USER,"With the Nazis and zombies, I think. If it is, I haven't seen it. I think I saw the preview for it at something I went to not too long ago. Yeah, it's not generally something I would probably go to the movies and see. But I would probably I think it was either directed by Eli Roth or If it's the one I'm thinking about, or he was a producer. So I probably would watch that one, but no, that's not something that I would go to the theaters and see."
CCPE-0cd98,21,ASSISTANT,Have you heard about the movie Thor?
CCPE-0cd98,22,USER,"Yeah, I saw that. I've seen all the Thors. I like it. The last one I thought was really good, probably the best of all of them."

CCPE-be71f,3,USER,"I don't know. It tends to be I guess the most interesting to me. It's difficult to explain exactly why that would be. But I'll think of something else. I'm interested in future and technology, so perhaps it relates to that."
CCPE-be71f,4,ASSISTANT,Is there a particular movie that you like?
CCPE-be71f,5,USER,The Matrix jumps to mind.

CCPE-be71f,11,USER,"They are just terrible, I don't understand why anyone would like them. Why would you want to scare yourself?"
CCPE-be71f,12,ASSISTANT,"Well, then have you seen the movie Deadpool?"
CCPE-be71f,13,USER,"Deadpool I think had a couple of sequels. I think I saw the first one, but I'm not sure if I'm getting it confused with one of the later ones."
CCPE-be71f,14,ASSISTANT,"Ok, what was it about deadpool you liked or dislike?"
CCPE-be71f,15,USER,"It was okay. I didn't have any particular opinion about it honestly. It was kind of edgy I guess in a kind of new way, but I wasn't a huge fan to be honest."

CCPE-105fd,11,USER,"So to me, this was a very hyped movie. It was touted as sort of like a a great teen film, and I was let down by it. It's not that it didn't have some funny lines. It did, but for the most part, they were already featured in the commercials. So the movie itself, it came I know it sounds strange to say for a teen movie, but it came across very juvenile. A little too simple. It seemed to be I don't know, going for"
CCPE-105fd,12,USER,what a teen movie what like adults think of what teens are doing. It was very simple and just it's just not that funny it's not something used for a teen movie. I usually love it and I re watch it a million times. I've never re watched Superbad and I have no plans to.

CCPE-fd077,4,ASSISTANT,can you name a movie that you really liked?

CCPE-fd077,9,USER,I don't like
CCPE-fd077,10,USER,Let's say I just I I just don't like a lot of family dramas. I don't like a lot of comic book like the like some of the Marvel stuff that's coming out. I don't really like the story telling they're doing with that cuz it's not the same as how they were written back in the '60s like in the actual comic books some of the superhero movies. I don't like reboots. Like they keep rebooting Spider-Man
CCPE-fd077,11,USER,"And I mean it's cool that they're doing that, but I just I just don't like that they're changing up the characters like they're changing the race. I mean I get that there are social quality and going on and, you know, they want people all to be accepted by their change in their character that's in a comic book. There could be a white character changing into a girl, it could be a gender change, or it could be a racial change. It's just not how it went."
CCPE-fd077,12,USER,"I mean I'm not saying that you can't do that, but it's not how the story went. Stick to the story. Be authentic, so"
CCPE-fd077,13,USER,I don't I don't really like those kinds of movie like that.

CCPE-fd077,15,ASSISTANT,can you name a movie that you didn't like?
CCPE-fd077,16,USER,"Oh, I kind of didn't like Spider-Man: Homecoming a little bit saw a little bit I just didn't like how the characters were developing it wasn't the same as the amazing Spider-Man which was pretty good the one with Tobey Maguire which was Spider-Man 1 2 and 3 with venom like all those were just I thought were all well written and good good directing and characters."
CCPE-fd077,17,USER,And that was lacking in Homecoming.
CCPE-fd077,18,USER,"So, it's pretty much that one, too."
CCPE-fd077,19,ASSISTANT,have you seen aquaman?
CCPE-fd077,20,USER,"I've not seen it, but it actually looks like it's okay. It's kind of kind of looks like they added too much CGI to it, and I'm not a big fun of overusing CGI. I think it's good to use but not that much."
CCPE-fd077,21,USER,Okay.
CCPE-fd077,22,ASSISTANT,how about pulp fiction?
CCPE-fd077,23,USER,"Pulp Fiction was pretty good. I thought John Travolta did good in it, Samuel Jackson was all right. I think I saw it maybe a couple times. A lot of people say it's a cool classic. I thought Quentin Tarantino did good directing in it, too. So,"
CCPE-fd077,24,ASSISTANT,what did you like about it?
CCPE-fd077,25,USER,It was kind of threw you off a lot at times. It was different things going on in the movie.
CCPE-fd077,26,USER,"So, that was pretty cool."
CCPE-fd077,27,USER,"Okay, we changed to like another another scene and"
CCPE-fd077,28,USER,"And it would go to another one. They just had like different things going on, so"
CCPE-fd077,29,USER,"A little bit of action, a little bit of comedy. That's about it."

CCPE-c860a,24,USER,"I thought in a vacuum, it was a good movie. If looking at it just strictly as a If you take exactly what they're doing onscreen, I think it's a very charming, likable movie. Stepping away from it, I think there's a lot of flaws to the movie. There is it's an incredibly white, Caucasian movie for a movie to be about jazz, and be almost completely white, Caucasian is ridiculous."
CCPE-c860a,25,USER,"There's the one black guy in it. They have the white guy telling the black guy about jazz, so a lot of things about it don't ring true, but if you are just watching the film and trying to enjoy it for what they put on the screen, it's a very likable movie."

CCPE-c9778,9,USER,"Yes. The Ugly Truth, that's a romantic comedy I don't like."
CCPE-c9778,10,ASSISTANT,Why did you not like this movie?
CCPE-c9778,11,USER,"It is billed as a romantic comedy, but it's kind of more a gross out comedy. And it just doesn't work. It doesn't have sort of like the regular elements of a romantic comedy, and it has a more gross out juvenile humor. The lead in Gerard Butler leaves a lot to be desired. It's just It's a bad casting for Katherine Heigl, even though I usually like her, but not in this. It's just It's wrong on so"
CCPE-c9778,12,USER,many levels. It was from start to finish terrible.

The writing is very clever, it's a very original, it's also a little more out there. I like more absurd humor, and this has parts of that in it. And it's It was a movie that was more traditionally would have been something that starred men."
CCPE-c9778,21,USER,So it was special that it starred women.

CCPE-387c5,19,ASSISTANT,What two things do you specifically appreciate about it?
CCPE-387c5,20,USER,"Sure, I think it has a really interesting sort of character. I mean, who really wants a character who can't really speak, but it was superbly acted by the female character, "
CCPE-387c5,21,USER,"so it was a really good attention-grabbing thing in order to get people drawn into the story, and I also like the relationship that the two characters have with each other, the amphibian and as well as the newt lady, so I think it's quite nice and it also has some really good action, some really good tension going on, so I think overall, it's a pretty solid movie."

CCPE-03d99,13,USER,"So the problem with the Armageddon is it has action with no purpose and it has an incredibly incomplete screenplay like a story line.

CCPE-03d99,20,USER,"Sure, Bridesmaids is incredibly well-written. It is not overdone, so it's not trying too hard to go I think into sort of trying too hard to be funny is just sort of is funny the way it's written which is one of its true strengths. And the other huge strength is its cast which is in someway subtle and someway obvious. But for each role, it was just perfect"

It's incredibly engaging. It pulls you in. "
CCPE-e7ee4,29,USER,"The lead, in Jennifer Lawrence, is extremely well cast and just excellent in the role. It's sort of a bizarre dystopian world they're taking you into. And it's executed beautifully, despite how bizarre, really, that the world is that they that you're going into."

CCPE-791c2,9,USER,"This movie was lacking and it despite it what they thought when they put it out, it was so bad and in general, I actually love Katherine Heigl movies but I do not like Gerard Butler movies and he is the lead actor in this and it was just rough from all around."

He's really good very good director, so flowed really well. The cast is funny and it's just nice to see something different on on the screen and really it was a little bit, different offered something different, despite being familiar and that it's a romantic comedy and it's funny. But, it was a refreshing change of pace."

It's shot really well. The plot's good. A few places the script could have been changed. I don't think people actually sort of talk like that in real life. But apart from that, I thought it was shot really really well."

The action has been tepid at best, and the story and the tone of the movie has gotten so serious, it's almost like a drama. And it's just not fun anymore."

CCPE-0126d,18,USER,"It was surprising surprisingly good because I don't really like dystopian futuristic stuff, but I think because of the casting in particular and the way it was done it was really good."
CCPE-0126d,19,ASSISTANT,"Ok, Is there anything else about that type of genre you really like?"
CCPE-0126d,20,USER,"No, its usually a genre that is a mess, but that was a good movie."

CCPE-b87e8,21,USER,The original movie had a specific ambiance. I guess it's hard to explain. It felt like you're part of a world that was woven by the director. The new one just felt like it was an action movie.
CCPE-b87e8,22,USER,And there wasn't there wasn't that much. It felt like it was kind of drab. Let me put it that way.
CCPE-b87e8,23,ASSISTANT,do you like how the first one has a more noir style?

CCPE-ab5d4,0,ASSISTANT,Do you like movies like the Spotlight?
CCPE-ab5d4,1,USER,"Yeah, for the most part I do like movies like Spotlight."
CCPE-ab5d4,2,ASSISTANT,Ok. What is it about this type of movie that you like?
CCPE-ab5d4,3,USER,It's a controversial topic that is covering and it's trying to send a message about what they're doing now. It depicted a preachiness I think because that's what the journalists were doing but still came off a little bit that way but a really great movie and it doesn't take away from it. It's just a little bit I I still would put all the president's men of those kinds of movies ahead of spotlight one of the reasons because of that.
CCPE-ab5d4,4,ASSISTANT,Do you like movies like Inside Man?
CCPE-ab5d4,5,USER,I don't know that movie.
CCPE-ab5d4,6,ASSISTANT,Do you like movies like Good Will Hunting?
CCPE-ab5d4,7,USER,Love Good Will Hunting.
CCPE-ab5d4,8,ASSISTANT,Ok. What is it about this type of movie that you like?
CCPE-ab5d4,9,USER,"Well, for this particular movie, the cast was perfect. Now you got the cast to be perfect because of the involvement of the actors in making the film, otherwise they would have gone for bigger names at the time, and a different cast, and it wouldn't have been such a good movie. That they came off as authentic to the Boston area was an important part of the movie. The script is great. The actors are excellent."
CCPE-ab5d4,10,USER,"It's believable, and also really hopeful. They're original story, which is amazing. Really an amazing story that they came up with. And But also had moments of lightness to it that help balance out sort of the more serious journey that the movie takes you on."
CCPE-ab5d4,11,ASSISTANT,Can you say a little more about that please?
CCPE-ab5d4,12,USER,"Sure, the movie itself is rather serious. It's taking, you know, a guy who was sort of ordinary and not making a ton of money to being someone who everybody wanted sort of a piece of to study because his mind was so amazing, and it had been discovered. So it's a very serious movie, but him dating Minnie Driver's character, his involvement"
CCPE-ab5d4,13,USER,"storyline with Robin Williams is extremely serious, given his background. Yet, the times with his friends, with Minnie, with Robin, where there's a few lighter moments that have to balance out the movie into a much more well-rounded movie than it otherwise would have been."
CCPE-ab5d4,14,ASSISTANT,Do you like movies like When Harry Met Sally?
CCPE-ab5d4,15,USER,Love When Harry Met Sally. Love it.
CCPE-ab5d4,16,ASSISTANT,Ok. What is it about this type of movie that you like?
CCPE-ab5d4,17,USER,"Well, first of all, it's a romantic comedy, which is my favorite genre. When Harry Met Sally itself is"
CCPE-ab5d4,18,USER,"Exceptional in that it doesn't try to do too much except what they are trying to do. They are two actors who are really they are focused on mostly on the two actors and then the four actors. They do it so well, the script is absolutely amazing, the direction is fantastic, it really doesn't try to be more than it is and it's totally charming and you can watch it a million times."
CCPE-ab5d4,19,ASSISTANT,Can you say a little more about that please?
CCPE-ab5d4,20,USER,"Sure. Some of the best movies ever made are fantastic, but you don't always want to watch them over and over and over again. When Harry Met Sally is the kind of movie that is fantastic, and as a romantic comedy, a little more approachable, a little more likable, and it's something you can watch many many times over the years. I've seen that more times than I can count, and even though I know what's going to happen, it's enjoyable every time."
CCPE-ab5d4,21,ASSISTANT,Thank you for another most insightful critique. Have a nice weekend.

I like them because they have They seem to always really get get really good actors, and I just like comic books in general, and then the themes that the they use in the movies, and the production value of them is generally top notch, especially the Marvel ones."
CCPE-43503,2,ASSISTANT,Is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?
CCPE-43503,3,USER,"I really like the the Iron Man ones, the very first one especially, and the second one was really good. But I guess right now probably The Avengers. That series is just really good. The last one wasn't quite as good as the first two, but I hear good things about the second one, or the next one that's coming out, so I can't wait to see that one."
CCPE-43503,4,ASSISTANT,Are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?
CCPE-43503,5,USER,"I am not a big horror fan. Lot of people like that like the Purge movies or I don't know, The House on Haunted Hill. I can't really think of a lot of the names cuz to me, they all just kind of sound the same, but It's not to say I won't watch one, but I just don't actively It'd probably be more one that I would maybe rent at rent at Redbox or watch at Netflix. It's not something that I would go be waiting on a Friday night"
CCPE-43503,6,ASSISTANT,Is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?
CCPE-43503,7,USER,"No, not really a specific movie. Generally, if I don't like something, I just don't watch it. So I would have to to really dislike something, I would have to watch it all the way through. To me, if it's not If it's not any good in the first 15 or 20 minutes, I'll just stop watching or do something else. And I'm generally pretty good The movies that I go to the movies to see You know, I try to make sure that they're going to be really good and worth"
CCPE-43503,8,USER,"Worth watching before, so I don't have to like walk out of the movies or anything. But if it's something that I've rented or try to watch on Netflix it's no good, after about 10 to 15 minutes, I'll just switch."

I don't even think I might have one maybe with him in it, but I think it was with him and somebody else. But so it's not like a comic book character that I thought I wasn't sure if I would enjoy the movie, but it was very surprising cuz it was probably one of the best the best Marvel movies they've done so far,"

CCPE-ddb2f,3,USER,The pretty Pretty Woman is one of my favorite movies.
CCPE-ddb2f,4,ASSISTANT,Great. Why did you like it?
CCPE-ddb2f,5,USER,"Pretty Woman is sort of a I think it gets billed as a romantic comedy, but it's much more of a romantic comedy drama. It has a lot of dramatic points to it. The pairing of Julia Roberts and Richard Gere is pitch-perfect, and it's one of the best pairings to like every grace the big screen. So the writing on the movie is fantastic."
CCPE-ddb2f,6,USER,the interactions between the characters especially Julia and Richard are what really make the movie and it's it's a wonderful it's a funny endearing movie.
CCPE-ddb2f,7,ASSISTANT,Alright. Can you name a bad movie?
CCPE-ddb2f,8,USER,Sure. The Ugly Truth is a bad movie.
CCPE-ddb2f,9,ASSISTANT,What was so bad about it?
CCPE-ddb2f,10,USER,"Where to begin? It was billed as a like when it was promoted on commercials and start it was builled as a romantic comedy. It is not. It is It All it has a star of a man and a woman who were supposedly supposed to be in a romance . It's more of a gross out comedy, sort of a shock comedy. It had gross out humor. It had a lot of"
CCPE-ddb2f,11,USER,"rudeness and juvenile behavior. It was really bizarre what they were going for. I usually like Katherine Heigl, this was not a good movie. And her co-star in it, Gerard Butler, he is highly overrated. I don't know how he keeps getting these starring roles."
CCPE-ddb2f,12,ASSISTANT,Got it. Have you seen Bridesmaids?
CCPE-ddb2f,13,USER,"Yes, I have."
CCPE-ddb2f,14,ASSISTANT,ok. What did you like about it?
CCPE-ddb2f,15,USER,"Bridesmaids is a great movie, funny, really well written, really well acted, and it's a little more original. It's sort of a but had a lot of laugh out loud humor and it had little more shocking humor at times, a little more"
CCPE-ddb2f,16,USER,"Graphic humor at times but with a female leading cast and that's being extremely rare in movies. So, it was a really refreshing movie but just a really a very funny one."
CCPE-ddb2f,17,ASSISTANT,"Okay, so have you seen Searching?"
CCPE-ddb2f,18,USER,"No, I don't think so."
CCPE-ddb2f,19,USER,"No, I haven't seen it."

CCPE-ddb2f,22,ASSISTANT,do you plan to see it?
CCPE-ddb2f,23,USER,"That's the one that I would watch if it came on TV, yeah, I would I would watch that one. It's I think it's just it's just like a general action movie like sort of action adventure. So, yeah, that one I'd watch."
CCPE-ddb2f,24,ASSISTANT,"okay, how about Nocturnal animals?"
CCPE-ddb2f,25,USER,"Oh god, no."
CCPE-ddb2f,26,ASSISTANT,why not?
CCPE-ddb2f,27,USER,"If I remember correctly, that is one of two things. That is either a scarier movie or a sort of a dramatic movie that has extremely that has a lot of darkness to it, sort of like verging on being a Quentin Tarantino movie. So probably something I'm not going to watch. It would have to be like an Oscar contending me for me to want to see that kind of a movie."
CCPE-ddb2f,28,ASSISTANT,so you don't like that type of movie?
CCPE-ddb2f,29,USER,"It's not my favorite. It doesn't mean I'll never I wouldn't I wouldn't watch it but it would have to be get like excellent reviews. It would have to be considered, you know, really critically acclaimed for me to probably watch a movie like that."
CCPE-ddb2f,30,ASSISTANT,okay. thank you for your time.

CCPE-bb0e1,2,ASSISTANT,what do you like about these kinds of movies?
CCPE-bb0e1,3,USER,Animation you could do a whole bunch of stuff that you cannot do with live action. Sometimes CGI is never the best option and the best way to go about like impossible stuff is do it in animation because the idea's limitless on what you can do.
CCPE-bb0e1,4,ASSISTANT,can you name a movie that you really liked?
CCPE-bb0e1,5,USER,Last movie I really liked was Justice League.
CCPE-bb0e1,6,ASSISTANT,what did you like about this movie?
CCPE-bb0e1,7,USER,"Even though they give bad stuff about the bad CGI in the movie, it's still a guilty pleasure of mine. I'm a real DC fan even though Marvel is good, but I still enjoy DC a lot more cuz their heroes and are a lot more and have more character to them. It was great seeing Batman played by Ben Affleck be pretty great. Superman was really good."
CCPE-bb0e1,8,USER,"Wonder Woman was enjoyable, and the introduction of Aquaman and Cyborg and Flash really made the movie interesting to watch. Especially Aquaman with his funny quotes here and there."

CCPE-bb0e1,13,USER,I sometimes forget they're dreams and cuz they like look so real sometimes.
CCPE-bb0e1,14,USER,"And probably like the realism of horror movies is what gets me. Cuz there are sometimes like I feel like when I'm home alone, something might happen to me when I don't want it to."
CCPE-bb0e1,15,ASSISTANT,can you name a movie that you didn't like?

CCPE-bb0e1,18,USER,I did not like X-Men: Days of Future Past at all.
CCPE-bb0e1,19,ASSISTANT,what did you dislike about it?
CCPE-bb0e1,20,USER,"I just didn't like the reboot of the X-Men. I think if they wanted to do more with the X-Men, they should've just went forward and ignored the first three first three movies, and added onto it with original characters like Wolverines, Cyclops, Patrick Stewart as the Professor."
CCPE-bb0e1,21,USER,"But yeah, I still like the move of making a brand-new trilogy for the X-Men. That's about it."
CCPE-bb0e1,22,ASSISTANT,cool! have you seen inside out?
CCPE-bb0e1,23,USER,"No, I have not seen Inside Out. But I I have that on the list of what I want to watch."

CCPE-bb0e1,25,USER,"I have not seen it. But I want to see it because my uncle is a huge Queen fan. Well, not huge, but he likes listening to Queen. And I am, too. And I would like to learn more about Queen because I wasn't born in that era or born in the era. Or know know what happened."

They had a villan that you really would love to hear. The director was pretty good. I enjoyed most of what the director made which was like Southpaw or training day.
CCPE-b86da,8,USER,And I really did enjoy the western vibe that was which was the main setting of the story.
CCPE-b86da,9,ASSISTANT,What do you check for when picking a movie?

CCPE-dbd31,2,USER,Black Panther
CCPE-dbd31,3,ASSISTANT,What is it about this type of movie that you like?
CCPE-dbd31,4,USER,"I like the superhero genre. This maybe in particular was a little bit different. It kind of dealt into the character a little more and wasn't wasn't just a you know wasn't just a superhero movie. It had a lot more to it, and it was a character that I didn't know a lot about, and start was kind of surprising and new to me."
CCPE-dbd31,5,ASSISTANT,Ok. now. Could you tell the name of a movie that you dislike?
CCPE-dbd31,6,USER,"Pretty much any horror movie. I'd say Or maybe like A Quiet Place was the only one I can really think of cuz to be honest, when I see horror movies' advertisements, I just usually kind of tune them out. But that one just seems kind of dumb to me. It was a world where you had to be completely quiet, otherwise the monsters were going to get you. It just didn't seem very realistic."
CCPE-dbd31,7,ASSISTANT,What is it about this type of movie that you dislike?
CCPE-dbd31,8,USER,"I'm just not a fan I mean they don't scare me and I'm just not a it's just not my cup of tea. And plus it seems like they come out with one every every couple of weeks there is a different hurt you know, some kind of different take on horror movies from old and then they start"
CCPE-dbd31,9,USER,"I'll take a good, old drama or a superhero movie any day."

CCPE-dbd31,20,ASSISTANT,Alright. Have you watched the movie Jason Bourne ?
CCPE-dbd31,21,USER,"Yeah, I've seen those. The first couple. I didn't really stick with it."
CCPE-dbd31,22,USER,"After the second one, where they killed his wife off, and they didn't do that at all in the books, I kind of stopped watching them. I might go back and watch them though, because it's been a while and I've reread the books since then, too. But I generally like that kind of movie, and it was a good movie. But it just ventured so far away from the books, and at the time, I had just finished reading the books when they came out, so after"
CCPE-dbd31,23,USER,"Well they killed her off early in the second movie and you know, in the book she really She stays on till the newer books came out. I don't know, it just kind of turned me off to them a little bit"
CCPE-dbd31,24,USER,But I would definitely be up to going back and watching them now.
CCPE-dbd31,25,ASSISTANT,Alright. Thank you for the information.

I try to watch it, re-watch it there's the first 3 seasons, and it was hard it was hard to get through it just because that is the acting's so bad "
CCPE-87f21,8,USER,"and the stars were so bad, but I like all the movies. The movies I haven't found a movie I didn't like in the Star Wars series. Although there was that one that was not quite as good as the rest, but Star Trek's good. I could go for another Star Trek movie."

CCPE-e6049,8,USER,"There is a movie like this movie called Super Buddies. I mean, I like animals and stuff, but this movie was just stupid and silly."
CCPE-e6049,9,ASSISTANT,what qualities specifically didn't u like about it?
CCPE-e6049,10,USER,"It just was really a silly plot. Didn't keep my interest. It was not what I thought it was going to be. You know, it was kind of silly."

CCPE-e6049,14,USER,"Yeah, I like Titanic. You know, it was based on real events and I thought the acting was great. I really liked it."
CCPE-e6049,15,ASSISTANT,"what qualities of the movie did u like, aside from the acting"

CCPE-5597b,0,ASSISTANT,What kind of movies do you like?
CCPE-5597b,1,USER,I like a good action movie.
CCPE-5597b,2,ASSISTANT,Like Mission Impossible?
CCPE-5597b,3,USER,"Love that series the the latest one, Fallout, is one one of the best action movies, I think, ever."
CCPE-5597b,4,ASSISTANT,What did you like about it
CCPE-5597b,5,USER,"Well like I think most people probably, the stunts and how real they looked and knowing that Tom Cruise actually did them was part of why they were so exciting."
CCPE-5597b,6,ASSISTANT,What parts didn't you like?
CCPE-5597b,7,USER,Of Mission: Impossible? Well the stories are never that great. They're always kind of convoluted and hard to follow. But I thought the latest one was probably one of the better stories cuz it was pretty simple.
CCPE-5597b,8,ASSISTANT,What movies do you stay away from?
CCPE-5597b,9,USER,"Oh. Well as a genre, usually kind of rom com, romantic comedies."
CCPE-5597b,10,USER,"I like comedies. And I don't mind the romantic things. I don't know. Maybe it's just all those movies seem to be the same movie. But, I don't know. I just don't typically like them very much."
CCPE-5597b,11,ASSISTANT,Did you watch the Hunger Games series?
CCPE-5597b,12,USER,"I saw the first one, and I think the second one, but I didn't finish it, no."
CCPE-5597b,13,ASSISTANT,What did you dislike about the first one?
CCPE-5597b,14,USER,"Maybe cuz it wasn't rated R. I don't know. It seemed like the premise of it deserved or required a more violent or harsher take, a more adult, and I think it felt like they like pulled their punches a little bit, and it also seemed like a story I'd kind of seen before."
CCPE-5597b,15,USER,I don't know.
CCPE-5597b,16,ASSISTANT,Have you seen Battle Royale?
CCPE-5597b,17,USER,"Yes, I think there's multiple like sequels maybe of them. But I haven't seen those. I've seen the first one though, the original one that Hunger Games is compared to a lot of times."
CCPE-5597b,18,ASSISTANT,What did you like about Battle Royale?
CCPE-5597b,19,USER,"Well, it kind of I guess hits that note of you know it's the premise is dark it's you know kids or school age kids killing each other and it actually shows the violence of that. So like if you are going to go with that premise, go with that premise all the away. Don't Don't try to mitigate it with like a PG 13 rating or something like go all in or don't go all."
CCPE-5597b,20,USER,"I don't go at all, and I think that was probably the biggest difference in those two movies."
CCPE-5597b,21,ASSISTANT,"Thank you for your input, have a great day"

CCPE-a7c9d,1,USER,I really like romantic comedies. They're my favorite.
CCPE-a7c9d,2,ASSISTANT,What appeals to you with these type of movies?
CCPE-a7c9d,3,USER,"They are funny. Usually a little lighthearted, usually has possibly heartwarming, has a happy ending, so it's nothing that will really get you down, and it's usually something that you'll leave feeling good after watching. They're also really easy to watch."
CCPE-a7c9d,4,ASSISTANT,That's awesome
CCPE-a7c9d,5,ASSISTANT,Is there a specific movie you enjoy from this genre?
CCPE-a7c9d,6,USER,"Yeah, While You Were Sleeping is one of my favorites."
CCPE-a7c9d,7,ASSISTANT,What did you like about this movie?
CCPE-a7c9d,8,USER,"It was an unexpected delight. It is extremely well acted and well written, but it's it's sort of an untraditional. It's not a traditional romantic comedy. It is sort of a romantic comedy paired with a family comedy, and it really works, but it's it's it's very endearing."
CCPE-a7c9d,9,ASSISTANT,It's nice to see movies not follow a formula and go out of the box
CCPE-a7c9d,10,USER,"Yes, very true."
CCPE-a7c9d,11,ASSISTANT,Are there any type of movies that you don't enjoy?
CCPE-a7c9d,12,USER,I'm not the biggest fan of scary movies.
CCPE-a7c9d,13,ASSISTANT,What about these movies is unappealing?
CCPE-a7c9d,14,USER,"I just don't enjoy being scared. It could It can cause me to have nightmares, so in order to actually watch a scary movie, I have to sort of remind myself that it's fake, which sort of takes away the point of watching it in the first place, so I usually just avoid them."
CCPE-a7c9d,15,ASSISTANT,I can definitely understand that
CCPE-a7c9d,16,ASSISTANT,Is there a specific movie that you heavily dislike?
CCPE-a7c9d,17,USER,If that's a horror film
CCPE-a7c9d,18,USER,"Like Alien is a great movie, but not one I could ever watch."
CCPE-a7c9d,19,ASSISTANT,What do you dislike about this movie?
CCPE-a7c9d,20,USER,That'll give me nightmares.
CCPE-a7c9d,21,USER,"It has literally things that will give me nightmares. Like the pictures from it, I've watched a few minutes here and there, and it is It's so disgusting and definitely things that I would somehow work into my dreams that would turn into nightmares. So despite it being well acted and one of Sigourney Weaver's best movies ever, I just can't."
CCPE-a7c9d,22,ASSISTANT,Have you seen the movie Crazy Rich Asians?
CCPE-a7c9d,23,USER,"Yeah, that's a great movie."
CCPE-a7c9d,24,ASSISTANT,What did you like or dislike about this title?
CCPE-a7c9d,25,USER,"First of all its great because it has a cast that's Asian which is very unusual for a romantic comedy. Its unusual in general for a Hollywood movie but its even unusual for a romantic comedy. So it was nice a nice change and still kind of like an ordinary romantic comedy story, so it really worked, very funny, very good cast, and I'm looking forward to the sequel."
CCPE-a7c9d,26,ASSISTANT,Thank you for your time and have a great day! Bye!
CCPE-35c79,0,ASSISTANT,What kind of movies do you enjoy and why?
CCPE-35c79,1,USER,Some of my favorites are romantic comedies.
CCPE-35c79,2,ASSISTANT,Is there a particular film you enjoy?
CCPE-35c79,3,USER,Yes. I love You've Got Mail.
CCPE-35c79,4,ASSISTANT,What did you like about that kind of film?
CCPE-35c79,5,USER,"The cast is fantastic, the writing is superb, and it's just very heartwarming but also very funny and obviously there is romance. The supporting cast is really good and adds to the overall film, so it's just not about the romance. Every part of it actually works including the parts where they're not together and it's not about them, it's more about the businesses that are competing. So, the whole movie is great but it's something"
CCPE-35c79,6,USER,You can watch over and over again.
CCPE-35c79,7,ASSISTANT,Is there a particular movie you don't enjoy?
CCPE-35c79,8,USER,The ugly truth is that movie I really don't like that's like a romantic comedy I don't like.
CCPE-35c79,9,ASSISTANT,What didn't you like about that kind of film?
CCPE-35c79,10,USER,"It was It's billed as a romantic comedy, but it's really more of a, I don't know, shock comedy or gross-out comedy. It is not endearing, not funny. It's sort of bizarre and crass. The humor is much more juvenile than what should be in a romantic comedy. It just didn't work all the way around. I usually like Katherine Heigl's movies, but that was a bust."
CCPE-35c79,11,ASSISTANT,Have you heard about the movie Deadpool?
CCPE-35c79,12,USER,Yes.
CCPE-35c79,13,ASSISTANT,Have you watched the movie before?
CCPE-35c79,14,USER,I have.
CCPE-35c79,15,ASSISTANT,What did you like about that kind of movie?
CCPE-35c79,16,USER,"I really like superhero movies which Deadpool is one, but this is a different one where there is a lot of focus on comedy and the writing is very important because there is such a focus on comedy and, so it's different but it really works. It's a very entertaining and a very atypical for a superhero movie and Ryan Reynolds is just great in it."
CCPE-35c79,17,ASSISTANT,Ok
CCPE-cc3dc,0,ASSISTANT,Tell me what type of movies you like.
CCPE-cc3dc,1,USER,I really like comedies and science fiction movies.
CCPE-cc3dc,2,ASSISTANT,"Perfect! Now, what would be one of your favorite movies?"
CCPE-cc3dc,3,USER,"I recently watched a movie called Sorry to Bother You, and I really enjoyed it."
CCPE-cc3dc,4,ASSISTANT,Got it. Could you give me some reasons you enjoy that type of movie?

CCPE-75ff1,0,ASSISTANT,What kinds of movies do you like?
CCPE-75ff1,1,USER,I really like romantic comedies.
CCPE-75ff1,2,ASSISTANT,Why do you like romantic comedies?
CCPE-75ff1,3,USER,They're fun. They're usually funny. They have a happy ending. They're more light-hearted in nature. And they're a nice escape.
CCPE-75ff1,4,ASSISTANT,"alright , how about a movie you liked?"
CCPE-75ff1,5,USER,One of my favorites is When Harry Met Sally.
CCPE-75ff1,6,ASSISTANT,Why did you like that movie?
CCPE-75ff1,7,USER,"That has a exceptional cast that really works on just about all cylinders in every single scene, and the writing is exceptional. It is funny and poignant and touching. It just really works and you can rewatch that movie a million times and still want to see it again."
CCPE-75ff1,8,ASSISTANT,"Interesting, is there a movie you did not like?"
CCPE-75ff1,9,USER,"The Bounty Hunter, that's not good."
CCPE-75ff1,10,ASSISTANT,Why not?
CCPE-75ff1,11,USER,"That has an actor who seems to regularly get cast, but is largely miscast especially in romantic comedies. He sort of doesn't give give off the right kind of charm for this kind of movies. He doesn't pull off comedy well. He doesn't pull off sort of charming handsome pursuiter well either."
CCPE-75ff1,12,USER,"And it's not a good showing from the leading actress either, it's just a poor script and poor execution."
CCPE-75ff1,13,ASSISTANT,"Ok, then have you seen the movie Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again"
CCPE-75ff1,14,USER,Yes.
CCPE-75ff1,15,ASSISTANT,What is it about these kinds of movies that you like or dislike?
CCPE-75ff1,16,USER,"Well, in general I do like sort of the nature of the movies light and fun and sort of based on music kind of a musical. That's not exactly musical but kind of a musical. Those are the kinds of movies I do like. Mamma Mia! is not my favorite but that's cuz it's sort of silly and doesn't have a lot to hold it together but in general I do like that kind of movie."
CCPE-2d12a,0,ASSISTANT,Tell me what type of movies you like.
CCPE-2d12a,1,USER,I like action movies.
CCPE-2d12a,2,ASSISTANT,"Perfect! Now, what would be one of your favorite movies?"
CCPE-2d12a,3,USER,Bourne Ultimatum
CCPE-2d12a,4,ASSISTANT,Got it. Could you give me some reasons you enjoy that type of movie?
CCPE-2d12a,5,USER,"Sure. The action is non-stop. The pace of that particular movie is perfect. It just keeps going. It has a like perfect rhythm to it, even though it does technically slow down at parts. The way that the, sort of, movie soundtrack and everything works, from start to finish for like 3 hours, doesn't stop and, the acting and the writing of the movie is excellent."
CCPE-2d12a,6,USER,so it's it's a it's easily one of my favorite movies ever.
CCPE-2d12a,7,ASSISTANT,Ok thanks. How about a movie you really didn't like?
CCPE-2d12a,8,USER,"Die Hard 5, A Good Day to Die Hard, I think that was called."
CCPE-2d12a,9,ASSISTANT,"Alright. And, what are some things you really don't like about that type of movie?"
CCPE-2d12a,10,USER,"What action movies, so technically I could have liked it and I basically loved everything else in the movie series but this fifth one it just really didn't use the lead character Bruce Willis as well and it had It was straining to have like subtitles. So, the story itself was not good but it was made more confusing by adding in subtitles to a series that didn't have them before."
CCPE-2d12a,11,USER,"and just sort of the way it played out was just pedestrian at best. So even though the technical action scenes were pretty decent, the entire movie, the story line wasn't very believable. It wasn't written all that well. It wasn't acted all that well. It just was a disappointment."
CCPE-2d12a,12,ASSISTANT,"Thanks! And, How about the movie The Shape of Water what do you think about that one?"
CCPE-2d12a,13,USER,"Although I haven't seen that one, the concept is not one that really appeals to me. I know enough about what the movie is and what it's about. The type of movie, like a drama, is fine, but the concept of that particular movie is not one that I'm likely to really enjoy a ton."
CCPE-2d12a,14,ASSISTANT,"Ok. And lastly, how about Frozen?"
CCPE-2d12a,15,USER,Frozen is a great movie.
CCPE-2d12a,16,ASSISTANT,What about that type of movie is great?
CCPE-2d12a,17,USER,"Well it's a animated movie, so in general, it seems like it could be geared much more towards children. But Frozen is a really well rounded, well written, well acted movie, so even though it is technically aimed at children, it's it's one that adults can easily enjoy and fall in love with. The music is great. The story line is endearing. It really works well."
CCPE-2d12a,18,ASSISTANT,Great! Thanks for your time!
CCPE-2d12a,19,ASSISTANT,See you later
CCPE-2d12a,20,USER,Sure. Bye.

CCPE-67170,20,USER,"Oh, it was based on a character that died several times in previous movies, so there's no logic to it."
CCPE-67170,21,ASSISTANT,so the illogically part is the part you find displeasing to watch?
CCPE-67170,22,USER,"Yes. Movie has to make some sense, even though it's a fantasy movie. It has to have some logic to it."

Not the Wayan Brother Scary Movie, the first or second one, but the the more recent ones, which I think they may have quit making now thankfully.

It felt like a movie from the '90s kind of like the Batman Robin which is and that's the problem with all the DC stuff, is it? Takes itself so seriously, but it it goes too far in trying to do that and imputes itself and"
CCPE-b1557,25,USER,"And they also I I understand they're trying to do that to set themselves apart from Marvel, but I don't think they're being very successful. And Justice League felt like it wasn't earned. They didn't set up these characters very well. The only character that anybody really likes in them is the Wonder Woman I guess Superman to an extent, but the reason they tried to quickly cash in and catch up to Marvel and I think it"

And this one was I mean, there was so much boring talk, there was subtitles."
CCPE-e2930,12,USER,"The action like the special backs that they did were good, but the story line was terrible and it just as I mean, it just was so bad.

So, it's sort of It really is a movie onto itself you're not going to get what you get when you go to see a Mission"
CCPE-e2930,17,USER,"possible in other movies and even though the cast can change from movie to movie, it's all really worked and I think it's because the they really get a good storyline, a good writer and every single Mission: Impossible movie has had a great director."

CCPE-545dc,15,USER,"I love most of the Marvel movies, but I also liked Guardians of the Galaxy because it was funny, it did have strong action, and the actors really acted well in it."
CCPE-86a5d,0,ASSISTANT,What kind of films do you like to see?
CCPE-86a5d,1,USER,I really like action movies.
CCPE-86a5d,2,ASSISTANT,Why do you like action movies?
CCPE-86a5d,3,USER,"They're a great escape. You are almost never thinking about much else besides the movie you're watching, kind of nonstop from start to finish, and they're usually a lot of fun. The action is a lot of fun. A lot of times, the storylines are either fun or intriguing, and all the better if the acting is good, and the action movies can sort of go"
CCPE-86a5d,4,USER,"both ways with acting, but usually there's enough action to carry things through if the acting's not there."
CCPE-86a5d,5,ASSISTANT,"Great, that's really good to know. Now what's a movie you've seen recently that you enjoyed?"
CCPE-86a5d,6,USER,recently
CCPE-86a5d,7,USER,Black Panther
CCPE-86a5d,8,ASSISTANT,"That's a fun one, did you like it?"
CCPE-86a5d,9,USER,I loved it.
CCPE-86a5d,10,ASSISTANT,Why?
CCPE-86a5d,11,USER,"It's very high quality action. It is very a lot of fun, actually very inspiring. The story is great, sometimes that suffers in this kind of movie, but this one, the story is great. It's very exciting, and it really is It's a very full complete movie. So, you really get a lot of great acting, great action"
CCPE-86a5d,12,USER,and it's just And it's also It really is a lot of fun.
CCPE-86a5d,13,ASSISTANT,"That's wonderful. I""m glad you enjoyed it! Now what kind of movies would you say you generally avoid?"
CCPE-86a5d,14,USER,I stay away from a lot of sci-fi movies.
CCPE-86a5d,15,ASSISTANT,Why's that?
CCPE-86a5d,16,USER,They can be good but a lot of them are high concept and the execution will be way off. And I watch a movie and try to understand it as opposed to sort of going with it and a good deal of the Sci-Fi don't make a lot of sense.
CCPE-86a5d,17,ASSISTANT,I see. that makes sense.
CCPE-86a5d,18,USER,Yes.
CCPE-86a5d,19,ASSISTANT,Based on what you've said I'm curious if you've seen Mission Impossible Fallout
CCPE-86a5d,20,USER,Yes.
CCPE-86a5d,21,ASSISTANT,What did you think of it?
CCPE-86a5d,22,USER,I loved it. I love all the Mission: Impossible movies. It's probably my favorite franchise at this point and it was as good as the ones before and it is
CCPE-86a5d,23,USER,"Always from start to finish. Usually really well edited so that there is not a lot of extra going on that sort of distracts from the movie. The characters are engaging, and one's that pull you in even though there is always several who are new and unfamiliar to you it doesn't seem to matter. It' just each of the Mission Impossible picks up and introduces you to"
CCPE-86a5d,24,USER,You like them and you just go with the story. It's always great.
CCPE-86a5d,25,ASSISTANT,That sounds like a good time! I'm glad you have a series you love.
CCPE-86a5d,26,USER,"Yes. I am, too."
CCPE-86a5d,27,ASSISTANT,So have you seen Escape room?
CCPE-86a5d,28,USER,No. That's a little scary for me.
CCPE-86a5d,29,ASSISTANT,Would you ever consider seeing it?
CCPE-86a5d,30,USER,"Yeah, like if my friends wanted to see it, I would go with them."
CCPE-86a5d,31,ASSISTANT,Thank you. One last question for you
CCPE-86a5d,32,USER,sure
CCPE-86a5d,33,ASSISTANT,"So I know you avoid Sci-fi, but you like action so I'm curious if you've seen Guardians of the Galaxy"
CCPE-86a5d,34,USER,I have not. That is
CCPE-86a5d,35,USER,"It I don't know, something about it seemed a little too busy, but people really love it, so I feel I'll I will see it at some point and I do like the Marvel movies so I probably will see it at some point. But it does seem a little a little much, I might not love it the way everybody else does, but I I will give it a try."
CCPE-226ad,0,ASSISTANT,what is your favorite movie?
CCPE-226ad,1,USER,"Oh god, there's so many."

CCPE-226ad,3,ASSISTANT,"back to the future, ok all of them or just one of them"
CCPE-226ad,4,USER,"All of them, especially the first one. The first one is the one that I saw when I was growing up, so it really left a deep impression on me."
CCPE-226ad,5,ASSISTANT,what is your favorite part of the movie? the setting or character or other
CCPE-226ad,6,USER,"All the characters, actually. They have their own little quirks and their own little backgrounds and everything. So, that's very cool. And especially, well, all the sets, you know? It's It's built like a real place. So, it feels real, too, if that makes sense. Like it's not like it's made up for the movie."
CCPE-226ad,7,ASSISTANT,do you think they predicted the future well
CCPE-226ad,8,USER,"Yes, although we don't have flying cars yet. But we have self-driving ones."
CCPE-226ad,9,ASSISTANT,would you like to have a flying car yourself
CCPE-226ad,10,USER,"Yes, it'd be very convenient until everybody has one and now the air spaces are too busy."
CCPE-226ad,11,ASSISTANT,when do you think those might come out
CCPE-226ad,12,USER,"Oh, boy! We are looking maybe in the next 50 years. I know they are working on it but before it is publicly available, it is going to be a long time."
CCPE-226ad,13,ASSISTANT,"that would be for awhile, what about characters, who do you like the most in the movie"
CCPE-226ad,14,USER,"Doc Brown, the professor. He plays a really good character in these It just worked out really well the way that they cast him, and he's really into character. Like it feels like he was made for the role."
CCPE-226ad,15,ASSISTANT,the professor? can you relate well with him
CCPE-226ad,16,USER,Yeah.
CCPE-226ad,17,USER,"Yeah, I like to tinker. Not that I invent things, but it does speak to me."
CCPE-226ad,18,ASSISTANT,ok if you like to invent things what would you like to invent or improve on
CCPE-226ad,19,USER,Better way to get your power.
CCPE-226ad,20,USER,"And if you think even Back to the Future, they had this little mini nuclear reactor for your house. That'd be awesome."
CCPE-226ad,21,ASSISTANT,like alternative energy?
CCPE-226ad,22,USER,Yes. Solar power is nice but it's still limited on it's form depending on the area that you leave.
CCPE-226ad,23,ASSISTANT,"thats very innovative yes, what about a scene you didnt really enjoy from the movie"
CCPE-226ad,24,USER,"The scene that I really liked was the one where he eventually gets back like the the whole suspense to last, you know, 15 20 minutes when they are building up trying to get him back to his own time."
CCPE-226ad,25,ASSISTANT,why do you like it
CCPE-226ad,26,USER,"It's suspenseful. It pulls you into the movie. Like the first time I saw it, I was on the ends of my seat and I was almost screaming at the screen, you know?"
CCPE-226ad,27,ASSISTANT,"where did you watch it, in the theater?"
CCPE-226ad,28,USER,No. I watched it at home. I wasn't old enough to go to the theater.
CCPE-226ad,29,ASSISTANT,"ah ok, that must have been very memorable scene as a child"
CCPE-226ad,30,USER,Yes. And it was a good movie to watch when we're young.
CCPE-226ad,31,ASSISTANT,can you share with me some movies you just dont like
CCPE-226ad,32,USER,"I hate sports movies. They just don't interest me, I think they're boring. If I wanted to watch something sports, I would watch it myself."
CCPE-226ad,33,USER,"Like I watch like real sports, not a sports movie."
CCPE-226ad,34,ASSISTANT,"ok there are many movies involving football players and tennis players, you are not interested in anyone of those?"
CCPE-226ad,35,USER,"If I have other options, then I would watch something else. If I had to pick, you know, if you go to movies, and you get to pick between three shows, then of those three movies and one of them is a sports movie, it's an automatic out."
CCPE-226ad,36,ASSISTANT,ok have you seen one like match point for example
CCPE-226ad,37,USER,No.
CCPE-226ad,38,ASSISTANT,how about other sports movies have you seen any
CCPE-226ad,39,USER,"Yeah, I've seen a few. I did enjoy Rocky. The first couple of Rocky movies were good. The Blind Side, which is a sports movie, but it's more a drama. And Space Jam, of course. Everybody loves Space Jam."
CCPE-226ad,40,ASSISTANT,the blind side and rocky would you say they are heavier on drama or the sports element
CCPE-226ad,41,USER,Drama.
CCPE-226ad,42,ASSISTANT,ok would that be a good reason why you are ok with them
CCPE-226ad,43,USER,"I think so. Yeah, I think that's a safe thing safe thing to say. The sports takes a background, with the drama to foreground."

CCPE-11d3f,29,ASSISTANT,do you think they Rode the coat tails of the firsts success.
CCPE-11d3f,30,USER,"Oh yeah. Definitely. And you know, I came to it late. I didn't see it when it first came out. I knew what I was getting into, and so it wasn't very surprising. But well it kind of was, cuz it was worse than what I had heard it was, so"
CCPE-11d3f,31,USER,"But, yeah. The third one was just bad. Only the acting wasn't bad, but the writing of the the whole plot was just kind of messed up. Compared to the first two, I mean, you're talking about two of the probably the two of the top 10 movies of all times."

I like how the people were actually in the simulation and how there were other forces controlling it, kind of think it was like foreshadow, like The Matrix, how it has a deeper meaning, some time of, not satire, but just an underlying meaning of it message."
CCPE-4f274,18,ASSISTANT,what else?
CCPE-4f274,19,USER,"It I like how it forced people in the Hunger Games to work together, people that they didn't like, how they end up working together and It It was just very intriguing seeing people change priorities when their life was at stake, and it's very interesting. Very on edge."

CCPE-fea93,8,USER,"Yeah. There's a story where it's just really weird, an it felt like they didn't know where they were going with the plot. So it's kind of like club all together into a movie.

But they still cast it correctly and didn't try to go for a bigger name and that net didn't necessarily hit the rocks, so that part they got completely correct. It was It's also more of a body comedy, it's not little Not afraid to be"

CCPE-a6067,9,USER,"in my very late 20s or maybe early 30s. So I was sort of out of the time when that was probably if I was maybe 10 years younger, I may have loved it. But it was a little juvenile for me even though it was funny, it did not resonate with why they were so obsessed with it. But it was funny, it was entertaining, it just wasn't didn't I didn't come away with it being a favorite or anything. It is sort of a it's a high school tale and that doesn't usually affect"

And in theory I could love Transformers, however Transformers is way more about sort of the action the you know the imagery that they're putting on film as opposed to making an actually good film. They're more they're more concerned with like the pyrotechnics, and the getting the action sequences right which can be exciting but in terms of trying to get through 2 hours it's not"
CCPE-a6067,15,USER,you would want to watch again. So it's It's okay. It's not It's sort of light on entertainment. There are other movies that I sort of that summer blockbuster that could have used a lot more time focusing on the script to make it into a more complete movie.

CCPE-a1cfc,6,ASSISTANT,Why did you like that kind of movie?
CCPE-a1cfc,7,USER,"The casting is excellent, and the writing is so great. It's like endearing, but it's also funny. It's also clever. Has some Even though romantic comedies are kind of predictable, there's still some sort of twists and turns that you don't necessarily see coming, so it's a very enjoyable watch. I can watch it at any time, rewatch it, and it always puts me in a good mood."
CCPE-a1cfc,8,ASSISTANT,Great. Now can you name for me a movie you didn't particularly enjoy?
CCPE-a1cfc,9,USER,"Sure, Ugly Truth that's just a bad movie it's a they built it as a romantic comedy but really it was sort of like a gross out of comedy and it was definitely surrounding a relationship but it was just bad. The acting which they had good actors in it but the writing was terrible, the direction was terrible, what they were going for was anything but what a romantic comedy gives off. It was not endearing it was not something"
CCPE-a1cfc,10,USER,that you root for. And what they made that they thought were jokes were not funny.
CCPE-a1cfc,11,ASSISTANT,I see. that's very helpful. Are there any kinds of movies you tend to avoid because of this movie? Or just in general you don't like?
CCPE-a1cfc,12,USER,"Yes, I do avoid movies with Gerard Butler he's with the stars of this movie and this movie along with a few others have convinced me I just I'm not a fan of his acting. He's not as dynamic as people try to say he is. He's acting is average at best but really he's missing a sort of charisma an on air presence that I really that I can sort of get behind."
CCPE-a1cfc,13,ASSISTANT,I see. Are there any movies coming out soon that you're interested in seeing?
CCPE-a1cfc,14,USER,Captain Marvel looks good.
CCPE-a1cfc,15,ASSISTANT,Why does it look good to you?
CCPE-a1cfc,16,USER,"I think I like Brie I like Brie Larson, she's a star."
CCPE-a1cfc,17,USER,I like the
CCPE-a1cfc,18,USER,"I think that I like a super hero movie so I think I will like this. The action, the excitement, Usually super hero movies have better story lines than regular action movie so I look forward to that too. I don't really know the Captain Marvel story, but I think that will be good."
CCPE-a1cfc,19,ASSISTANT,"Oh cool, speaking of superhero movies, did you see the Incredibles 2?"
CCPE-a1cfc,20,USER,"I like the first one a lot. It's an animated movie, which can be very juvenile. But this one was very easy to like as an adult. It's just funny and cute, it definitely worked. So, I'm definitely interested in seeing a second one."
CCPE-a1cfc,21,ASSISTANT,"Okay great, that's very good to know. Now what about Batman v. Superman? Did you see it?"

I watched the first 10 minutes. I thought, this is not going to be good, so I just sort of left it at that, even though I love the TV show.

CCPE-d2066,3,USER,"I enjoy historical movies, and war movies, action movies, and the first 20 minutes of that movie are some of the most visceral war movie making ever, and the rest of it is just a good story that shot well, and"
CCPE-d2066,4,USER,"I think makes you feel what felt like to be in World War II, maybe."
CCPE-d2066,5,ASSISTANT,Ok. now. Could you tell the name of a movie that you dislike?

CCPE-d2066,7,USER,"Oh, yeah, It's written by David Mamet."
CCPE-d2066,8,USER,"And the reason I don't like it is Mamet is a very stylized writer, and I thought it was laughable what he wrote our house part the dialogue and everything. It was awful."

CCPE-d2066,12,ASSISTANT,Anything about this kind of movie that you dislike ?
CCPE-d2066,13,USER,about Hunger Games
CCPE-d2066,14,USER,"Maybe it's a I would have to really think about that one, but if I had to guess, it was probably because it's a I think it was a PG-13 movie, and I feel like the premise warrants a more of a rated R mature look at the story. "
CCPE-d2066,15,USER,"I think it tried to be It undercut its purpose in what it was trying to say about the dystopia by being a PG-13 movie for teenagers, if I had to guess, but"
CCPE-d2066,16,ASSISTANT,ok. now. Have you watched the movie Dunkirk ?
CCPE-d2066,17,USER,Yes.
CCPE-d2066,18,ASSISTANT,did you like it?
CCPE-d2066,19,USER,"I thought the Nolan does really well with sound design and manipulating you through sound and visual, but he broke it up the narrative of it and it was it was unnecessarily hard to follow. It made sense by the end, but it didn't help the story, and I thought it took away from what he was trying to get across. "
CCPE-d2066,20,USER,"And he kept taking me out of the movie, whereas some might say even Wright Ryan that is very impassive, I thought Don Cork was the opposite of that except for the sounds and it was shot well. But there is very little character development, I can't name you any other characters or really any of the stories of the characters were."
CCPE-d2066,21,USER,"So, I would say I'm kind of in the middle on that movie, but slightly to the negative."

It's sort of It is a romantic comedy, but it has a little more seriousness to it because at the start of it, it's goes off of following somebody's death, so it's sort of like a quieter movie, and it's not as laugh out loud as a lot of comedies"
CCPE-39c55,5,USER,"but it's still very funny. It's humorous I should say. It has very humorous parts and it has really really enduring characters and they are totally rooting for the romance to happen and it's just It really is Even though it started with a death, it's very fun and light-hearted movie that ends fantastically."
CCPE-39c55,6,ASSISTANT,Is there a movie you dislike?
CCPE-39c55,7,USER,I really didn't like A Good Day to Die Hard.

They don't use the main character from entire series well. "
CCPE-39c55,10,USER,The supporting characters basically just terrible. There's there's there's use of subtitles a lot which is kind of strange given that it's coming in series that's all spoken in English. It's It was really really disappointing.

CCPE-39c55,21,USER,"You know what? Bridesmaids is funny from start to finish. And they really really nailed the cast. At the time, some of them were kind of more unknown, especially in a movie context. But they really nailed the cast, and even though the movie itself got attention for the true laugh out loud moments, some of the more quieter moments, the sort of humorous, maybe not laugh out loud things were some of my favorite parts of the movie. So But it really"

CCPE-0a315,7,USER,"Oh gosh. It's like I'ts perfect. It's a mockumentary style film and they are mocking the dog show world. So, the dog show world that they show is like a carbon copy of the real thing because it's inherently funny, so they don't have to really max with it. And a lot of the player they it there's a script for the movie but it's also ad libed."

Neither role really fit the actor, like they were sort of playing against type in both roles. I think it was kind of supposed to be almost like a almost like a buddy comedy, but or Cuz it was really focused on two people, but not really buddies, but they were in conflict. It wasn't funny."

CCPE-0a315,24,ASSISTANT,"ok, what about the movie did you enjoy?"
CCPE-0a315,25,USER,"It really has a different feel to it. It's despite them being, you know, prisoners, they create very endearing characters who you rooting for, who you want to see have a better life. It is a You're transported to a different time so you can sort of capture what was going on better."
CCPE-0a315,26,USER,"It very moving, it very and and it's very touching which usually does not happen with something that's sort of a prison drama. I don't you ever really view them as true prisoners some of whom shouldn't really have gotten as steep of sentences as they do or like somebody who walks who was there far too long for what it sounded like he was in for and then couldn't live in the real world having been locked up so long. So, it's it's it's a it's just a it's a excellent film."
CCPE-0a315,27,USER,"with amazing acting, wonderful direction and it's just It's very special. It it really is. It's it's one of those wonder you look back and you wonder why didn't want to win Oscar."

CCPE-24582,13,USER,"Yeah, the the remake of The Haunting."
CCPE-24582,14,ASSISTANT,"ok, why didn't you like that movie?"
CCPE-24582,15,USER,"I don't know. It wasn't as good as the first one. The first one was almost like a Hitchcock movie. It was so well done. Nothing ever happened in the movie, but you just there was so much suspense, and you just imagined so much. The movie made you imagine. And the original movie was in black and white. It was just a really good concept, and it was so well done."

CCPE-24582,20,USER,"had the Winchester estate, not the Winchester estate, Churchill Winston Churchill's estate. There was a picture of someone in Winston Churchill's estate. There was a video of someone in Winston Churchill's estate at the beginning of this movie."
CCPE-24582,21,USER,That That's a real place. They don't make movies like that anymore. The The last documentary sort of miniseries they made was not Brideshead Revisited.

CCPE-6a33c,4,ASSISTANT,why is that?
CCPE-6a33c,5,USER,"I I really appreciate a slice of life drama, but I don't necessarily want to be brought to tears. I don't need it to be a sad I don't know where somebody is has a illness or something like that which can be a lot of focuses of many dramas. But, there are plenty that are more of a slice of life and there're executed really well so it's a very nice It still provides an escape despite"
CCPE-6a33c,6,USER,being realist and drama based.
CCPE-6a33c,7,ASSISTANT,What is one of your favorite movies?
CCPE-6a33c,8,USER,But The Usual Suspects is one of my favorite movies.
CCPE-6a33c,9,ASSISTANT,i really liked that movie. what did u think of the ending?
CCPE-6a33c,10,USER,It's still shocking. I I mean it it was so long ago and it's still one of the best executed movies that has ever been where you just did not see the ending coming. It's amazing.
CCPE-6a33c,11,ASSISTANT,What type of movies do you not like?
CCPE-6a33c,12,USER,I'm not crazy about sci-fi movies.
CCPE-6a33c,13,ASSISTANT,because?
CCPE-6a33c,14,USER,Because
CCPE-6a33c,15,USER,"Sometimes they are a little too overreaching. They are creating a world, like a maybe a dystopian or futuristic, or some kind apocalyptic world, and so it can become very, very complicated. And some of them are really done well, but the majority of them seem to overreach, and so you have to sort of figure out one part of the movie to like because the rest is sort of a mess."
CCPE-6a33c,16,ASSISTANT,that's very true
CCPE-6a33c,17,ASSISTANT,have you heard of the movie the greatest showman?

CCPE-6a33c,20,USER,"I like musicals. So, that really is basically a musical, and so it really does fall into that category. I like the sort of grandness of what they're going for, and it's a really great cast. Really It's an interesting story but a really great cast."
CCPE-6a33c,21,ASSISTANT,okay. have you seen the movie love actually?
CCPE-6a33c,22,USER,"Oh, yes."
CCPE-6a33c,23,ASSISTANT,What did you like about this kind of movie?
CCPE-6a33c,24,USER,"That's an all-time favorite, so it is a a romantic comedy. But it's actually I think it's nine romantic comedies in one movie, so it's like nine vignettes put together in one movie. And despite it being split up into so many different stories, every single one feels very complete. You don't feel like it's lacking, so it's a it's a little bit of a longer movie. But it's appropriately long, it's so"
CCPE-6a33c,25,USER,"fun. So heart-warming and just a a wonderful movie. You could watch it a million times, and it's absolutely great to watch near the holidays."
CCPE-6a33c,26,ASSISTANT,definitely a classic. i liked seeing each story

CCPE-22b4a,6,ASSISTANT,what did u like about it?
CCPE-22b4a,7,USER,"I love the the superhero itself. It's such an interesting concept for a superhero, the Ant-Man. The Ant-Man, I mean think about that for a second. Who could have pitched that to a studio and they would have been like, yeah, that's a good idea. I mean, it's such a phenomenal movie, such a phenomenal plot. If you haven't seen it"

CCPE-22b4a,12,USER,"Yeah, I didn't like the Suicide Squad movie. I really I really didn't like that movie I thought that one was like they sold out of it on that one. They just like they are delivering these lines they like I didn't really find good or funny. I don't think the plot was good. Some of the plot like they forced people to appear and you can tell like they are setting up for a sequel like when they say when they say like Well, you can just tell they are setting up for a sequel and then"
CCPE-22b4a,13,USER,"came out with the sequel, and I didn't go see that, because I thought the first one's worse. Like I'm not going to sit through something so terrible. And it's just the properties too, like none of the actors I'm not saying the actors aren't good or the plot isn't good or the story isn't good, but a lot of that's tertiary to the to the sale, you know?"

CCPE-13928,7,ASSISTANT,Can you tell me the things about that type of movie you remember liking?
CCPE-13928,8,USER,"Sure. Sleepless in Seattle is fantastic, especially because of the actors and the writing. The actors are at this point considered like legends, and although neither one of them really makes this kind of movie anymore, they really were the best at it for well over a decade. And the writing is clever and heartwarming and relatable,"
CCPE-13928,9,USER,"so it all really worked to make really funny films that you can watch. I still Even though that movie's 25 years old, I still watch it almost every year."

CCPE-13928,18,USER,"That's a good movie. It is It's a superhero movie and But it's a superhero megamovie where a lot of superheroes are in it. It is good. It is entertaining, but it probably has The Avengers movies are probably are not my favorite superhero movies, strictly because it's such a large cast of characters. So there's a lot going on"
CCPE-13928,19,USER,"it ends up being longer than I wish it would be. But in general, it's an easy thing to watch, and it's at the very least somewhat enjoyable, if not very enjoyable. Sometimes it can be very enjoyable."
CCPE-13928,20,ASSISTANT,I see. what else about that type of movie did you not like in particular?
CCPE-13928,21,USER,"You know, I really just don't like I think the length. It doesn't feel as sort of tight and edited as the better superhero movies are. It just feels like it it's sort of going on. And also that one, the first one too, they can get a little complicated. You know, I think they're trying to offer something completely different, and sometimes it's just not the most simple story line,"
CCPE-13928,22,USER,and it works against the movie being more enjoyable
CCPE-13928,23,ASSISTANT,"All right. Interesting. Are there types of movies you don't like? If so, tell me what about those types you don't like?"
CCPE-13928,24,USER,Sure. I don't like horror movies. I just don't like scaring myself and got so going to a horror movie is certainly going to do that. I know it's fake and for me to sort of get through it I have to almost tell myself that it's fake which defeats the purpose of going. Most people who like horror films like being scared so I I don't like being scared. It can cause me to have nightmares. So it's just the kind of movie I avoid and it's not something I enjoy.

CCPE-fdeca,4,ASSISTANT,What did you like about that movie?
CCPE-fdeca,5,USER,"It's actually It's It's really fun to watch. It is actually a take off of a Shakespeare novel, and so the lead character is undercover impersonating her twin brother, and basically falls in love with another student who doesn't know that she's posing as a guy. And it's just a lot of fun. The actors are extremely likable."
CCPE-fdeca,6,USER,"At the time, they were somewhat unknown. Amanda Bynes, who was the star, was not unknown, but the male lead, Channing Tatum was very unknown at the time, who's now a superstar.

CCPE-fdeca,11,ASSISTANT,What do you not like about Sci-Fi movies?
CCPE-fdeca,12,USER,"I don't dislike all sci-fi movies, but it's kind of particular which ones I like. I think the storylines can get very very complicated in a way that's almost unnecessary, like they should channel their focus more into one aspect or three aspects instead of you know, trying to tackle 20. And then sometimes I think about sci-fi, it's just you have to really stick the landing in the movie and"
CCPE-fdeca,13,USER,"If you don't, it's like a really It just doesn't come off well. So because it's such a It's sort of a concept movie where it's not It's not based in reality, there's a lot going on. When it's lacking, the whole thing falls apart. So if it doesn't come together on almost every way the way other movies don't need to, maybe there's a bad character, a plot point that doesn't really make sense, but it's no big deal. In sci-fi, it has to all work"
CCPE-fdeca,14,USER,"In order for it all to make sense and for the movie to be good, because already you're all in a alternate reality."
CCPE-fdeca,15,ASSISTANT,What movie did you last watch that was disappointing?
CCPE-fdeca,16,USER,"Any movie? I mean, last I could tell you a sci fi movie that's disappointing is Thirteenth Floor. That's terrible."

So, it has a little more to go with it. The writing of the movie is really good, very funny, both appealing to sort of younger and a little bit older. And the acting was"
CCPE-88e0d,9,USER,"across the board. At the time that the the actors were known to people like me who were younger and followed who had seen a few movies with some of these people in it, but later on, almost every one of the people in this movie has become a huge star."

CCPE-88e0d,26,USER,"There's a lot to build off of. So in that way, I think it worked. It is not my favorite movie, but I like what Steven Spielberg was going for.

CCPE-5c845,16,USER,People in charge of the movie were more interested in pushing identity politics and the left-wing political agenda and it put that overwriting and creating a good Star Wars movie and it shows. The movie gives us very shallow characters. It gives us let down after a let down 
CCPE-5c845,17,USER,"And it tries to fundamentally change the core values of the franchise's main characters such as Luke Skywalker, and it basically insulted as fans and supporters of the franchise in many different ways, whether it's the petty scenes where Luke is having to drink milk from the tit of a giant sea cow, or when he throws his beloved father's lightsaber over his shoulder as if it were worth nothing to the"

CCPE-485bd,10,ASSISTANT,Ok. Can you think of another movie you didn't like?
CCPE-485bd,11,USER,"I didn't really care for the new Spider-Man. I guess superhero movies don't really do much for me, but yeah, I didn't really like that, either."
CCPE-485bd,12,ASSISTANT,Too much of a fantasy storyline?
CCPE-485bd,13,USER,"Yes, it's just not believable at all."
CCPE-485bd,14,ASSISTANT,I see. Have you seen Ocean's Eight?
CCPE-485bd,15,USER,"Yes. I had to think about that for a second. Yes, and I actually loved all of those movies. They're funny, and they The crime aspect to it is intriguing to me, entertaining."

CCPE-26896,4,USER,"Twist at the end, the action, the science fiction, it all works for me."
CCPE-26896,5,ASSISTANT,It set the standard for action computer graphics. Everything after that had to at least live up that the original Matrix.
CCPE-26896,6,USER,"That's true, It changed a lot of for a long time how action scenes were shot especially with that slow motion 360 cam. Now we've kind of gone the opposite where it's like Jason Bourne movies where everything is so quick cut and you can't tell what's going on. I wish we could go back to the Matrix."
CCPE-26896,7,ASSISTANT,"What did you think about the hunger games? the action was there, as well as the CGI"
CCPE-26896,8,USER,"I think I only saw the first two Hunger Games and they were all right. I mean they they were no matrix or anything but I could see myself if it came on cable TV you know, as they say like a rainy Saturday afternoon or something. I could watch them again. But I don't own them and"

CCPE-0a55a,8,ASSISTANT,thanks for sharing. what about it was boring to you
CCPE-0a55a,9,USER,"It seems like they rehashed a storyline like they They didn't really come up with anything new. It was just the same old Whereas some sequels are a whole new story that's interesting, this just seemed like a cash grab, as they would say."

CCPE-5269f,0,ASSISTANT,What are some kinds of movies you like?
CCPE-5269f,1,USER,One of my favorite kinds is action movies.
CCPE-5269f,2,ASSISTANT,Why's that?
CCPE-5269f,3,USER,"They're The action is a lot of fun. Even though it's it's not something that you want to see in real life. It's a ton of fun on screen. They tend to be like sort of like non-stop, start to finish or great escape. And, usually if the story is good in good action movie the story is descent so if somebody getting saved"
CCPE-5269f,4,USER,skewed or they are on some mission to help a country or whatever the case may be and it's usually something you can root for so it's a good time.
CCPE-5269f,5,ASSISTANT,That's great. What other kinds of movies do you like?
CCPE-5269f,6,USER,"I also like Like similar to action movies, I also like superhero movies, which are a little bit different than action movies, but I do like those as well."
CCPE-5269f,7,ASSISTANT,I see. What's a movie you've seen that you really liked
CCPE-5269f,8,USER,One of my favorite action movies is definitely Mr. & Mrs. Smith.
CCPE-5269f,9,ASSISTANT,what's so good about it that it's your favorite?
CCPE-5269f,10,USER,"That's one that has excellent cast, really great acting, and it's one that pairs action and comedy really well. Some All the great things that you get of action movie, you know, the action, the whatever, the fighting, that those kinds of scenes that are very exciting, but also they do such a great job with the comedy. So, it's a really entertaining movie from start to finish. But"
CCPE-5269f,11,USER,"It's not all highly charged. There's a There's a a lot of levity, a lot of laughter, throughout."
CCPE-5269f,12,ASSISTANT,"That sounds fun! Now, switching gears, what kinds of movies do you dislike?"
CCPE-5269f,13,USER,I don't really like sci-fi movies.
CCPE-5269f,14,ASSISTANT,Why not? Aren't they very popular?
CCPE-5269f,15,USER,"Sci-Fi movies are very popular. For me, Sci-Fi can be a little too high concept. And it's not always well thought out or well executed. There's a lot of times where I watch a Sci-Fi, and I'll think this doesn't make much sense. And so, it's hard to like something when it doesn't really sort of carry through on whatever claim it's making in the beginning. Sci-Fi really struggles with that. So, if they do it well"
CCPE-5269f,16,ASSISTANT,"okay, that's pretty reasonable. So what's a movie you've seen that you disliked?"
CCPE-5269f,17,USER,"Like The Thirteenth Floor was not a good one. That's one where the concept Like till this day I still don't understand what they were trying to do. So It was interesting, it was a very good cast, it was a well acted movie, but the concept and what they were going for was so confusing. And it wasn't confusing the entire"
CCPE-5269f,18,USER,"movie, but it was confusing probably midway through till the end so that when you're done with the movie, you're looking at the person next you thinking do you understand what just happened cuz I did I don't I didn't get it. And and that's one where I've talked to other people who saw and they're like I didn't get it either. So, it's just the confusion that comes with sci-fi. It ends up not being the best movie going experience because I guess it does great conversation, but it's not great to"
CCPE-5269f,19,USER,"our conversation when we're all wondering what they were trying to go for, cuz they didn't pull it off very well."
CCPE-5269f,20,ASSISTANT,So it's important for you to get movies so you can talk about them afterwords?
CCPE-5269f,21,USER,"It's good if you can talk about them afterwards, but it is just important to get it, so that it's sort of a satisfying movie-going experience, rather than a confusing one. You want to go to the movies, enjoy it, and be happy you went, instead of thinking, ""I could've stayed home for all that."
CCPE-5269f,22,ASSISTANT,"I see. Now I""m curious if you have seen or heard of Avengers Age of Ultron"
CCPE-5269f,23,USER,"I have not seen it, but I have heard of it. It's one that I would watch. I've watched Avengers movies before. Like I said, I do like superhero movies. But the Avengers movies are not my favorite. They have so many characters, and so much going on, that while it can be mostly entertaining, it's usually just a lot it's just a lot going on. And it's just It's okay. It's just not my first choice."
CCPE-5269f,24,ASSISTANT,I see. Thank you.
CCPE-5269f,25,USER,You're welcome.
CCPE-5269f,26,ASSISTANT,I've got one more question if that's okay?

CCPE-5269f,29,USER,"Yes. I have as long as I have the second movie in the series. Yes, I've seen it."
CCPE-5269f,30,ASSISTANT,I didn't know it was a series. What did you think of it?
CCPE-5269f,31,USER,"It wasn't as good as the first one, but in general it's a really good paring between Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law, that really works. And he's a great as Sherlock Holmes, and it has a good feel for it. The comedic tone is great. The I would say the biggest problem with the movie in general is just it's script isn't as good as the first one. So, maybe they need"
CCPE-5269f,32,USER,like take more time to really come up with a good story that presents well on-screen. But you can still come away liking the movie because the characters are enjoyable.

Like I felt the choices people made were natural given the circumstances. The costuming was really great. And I thought the acting was really good. I you know You wouldn't think so with that kind of movie, like it's very It's action-oriented, so they're going to emphasize that more, but I thought the acting was compelling. I think Jennifer"

CCPE-d45c6,10,USER,A romantic comedy that I dislike?
CCPE-d45c6,11,USER,"Thou Be True, it's terrible."
CCPE-d45c6,12,ASSISTANT,What are the 2 things that you dislike about this movie?
CCPE-d45c6,13,USER,"It was So part of the problem was how it was billed. It was billed as a romantic comedy. That's how they advertised it, that's how they showed it, and that's how they acted like it was going to be when they started the movie. But it was really more of a gross out comedy, which was kind of popular at the time, I guess. And So you went in expecting a romantic comedy, and you What was really happening was sort of like taking comedy to the extreme in a very"
CCPE-d45c6,14,USER,"funny and sort of gross out juvenile manner. It was a mess. The second thing I really hate about it really the lead actor. Gerard Butler is sorely miscast. He just is not good for romantic comedies at all. He doesn't pull off any aspect of what you want out of a romantic He's not like good at lighthearted. He's not funny. And I guess he's good looking, but it doesn't really"
CCPE-d45c6,15,USER,It's not like that in a handsome way I guess.
CCPE-d45c6,16,ASSISTANT,"Other than the casting of Gerald Butler, can you name a third reason?"
CCPE-d45c6,17,USER,"Sure. Just in general, the movie itself is poorly written. It's like it was"
CCPE-d45c6,18,USER,"I guess, I think probably trying too hard to be too many things, it certainly wasn't a romantic comedy and it was written in a way that one, I didn't laugh once, and two, the comedy they were going for was a wrong kind of comedy for romantic comedy."

CCPE-d45c6,23,ASSISTANT,Can you give a couple of reasons why you like this movie?
CCPE-d45c6,24,USER,It is
CCPE-d45c6,25,USER,"a really good ensemble cast. Sometimes it's hard to do an ensemble movie because there could be weak links throughout the cast, but this is one that is all around solid and the screenplay is exceptional. It is really well written, really well done and really captures the the true story that it was writing about and the"
CCPE-d45c6,26,USER,And it pulls off what they were trying to accomplish in terms of capturing the importance of a story that they needed to tell.
CCPE-d45c6,27,ASSISTANT,Do you like the movie Jurassic World?
CCPE-d45c6,28,USER,"I haven't see it, but I But that kind of movie is okay. I have seen the original Jurassic Park and Jurassic Park 2. And i do like the general feel of them, but those can tend to be a bit scary too, so I'm not sure if Jurassic World would be good for me, but I would see it."
CCPE-d45c6,29,ASSISTANT,Last question: can you give a couple of reasons why you like this movie?
CCPE-d45c6,30,USER,"I like action movies, and it's basically an action movie, so it has that sort of aspect of being exciting and kind of edge of your seat and you know, keeping you going from start to finish, so that's good. And then I do like the cast that they have in Jurassic World. I think they sort of I think they nailed it for sort of that sort of summer block"
CCPE-d45c6,31,USER,"so that's always great, and all of the Jurassic Park movies have fantastic visual effects, so it's a big budget movie. But it's big budget for a reason, they really get the feel of the dinosaurs and everything is so much more realistic than you'd think. And it really helps to carry off what they're going for in a movie."
CCPE-d45c6,32,ASSISTANT,Thank you. You give the best critiques! Good night.
CCPE-d45c6,33,USER,Good night.

CCPE-1e36b,11,ASSISTANT,Okay. And why do you avoid that kind of movie?
CCPE-1e36b,12,USER,"I usually avoid something that doesn't entertain me because I don't want to be bored or fall asleep in movies. Because if I wanted to fall asleep in movies, I don't want to pay $20 in movie theater or five bucks just to rent a movie and then just fall asleep. If it's like thriller or horror movie, I don't want like to be scared cuz I can get scared easily and get nightmares."
CCPE-1e36b,13,USER,real bad dreams

CCPE-1e36b,22,ASSISTANT,Why did you feel disappointed in it?
CCPE-1e36b,23,USER,because
CCPE-1e36b,24,USER,The CGI was bad.
CCPE-1e36b,25,USER,It's It was disappointing cuz CGI was bad. I didn't like the plot or the villain they used at the end. I wish they could have done something smaller then went up
CCPE-1e36b,26,USER,And the cut that was in the theaters wasn't from the original director cuz he stepped out like near before re-shoots.
CCPE-1e36b,27,USER,"And So, they had some other director, and they used both directors cuts which was weird."
CCPE-1e36b,28,ASSISTANT,"That's fair. Now given what you've said, I'm curious if you have seen or heard of Aquaman"
CCPE-1e36b,29,USER,"I've heard of Aquaman. I didn't see it, but I want to because I'm a big Jason Momoa fan, and I heard it was pretty good, better than anyone expected. And the director James Wan did a pretty great job with the way the movie looks."
CCPE-1e36b,30,USER,"But, I do plan on seeing it some time soon. Probably when when I'm able to rent it or buy it on Blu-ray."
CCPE-1e36b,31,ASSISTANT,"I see, thank you. How about Deadpool 2?"
CCPE-1e36b,32,USER,"I love Deadpool 2. It's really funny. I lke how the character breaks the fourth wall and it's sort of comic book accurate. So, It was pretty interesting to watch. I didn't say it was better than the first one but it was still fun to see and I had a great time watching it."
CCPE-1e36b,33,ASSISTANT,Do you like when movies are comic book accurate?
CCPE-1e36b,34,USER,"Yeah, I do. It makes"
CCPE-1e36b,35,USER,"Well, I sort of do. Because if it's comic book accurate and you've read the comics, you already know what's going to happen. But when they change a little, I don't mind it. Like if they change a character to be a different race or gender, like okay, whatever. But"
CCPE-1e36b,36,USER,If it's a big thing where they change the origin story of the superhero then it's something I'll be skeptical about until I see it.

CCPE-6aeca,0,ASSISTANT,What kinds of movies do you like?
CCPE-6aeca,1,USER,I like movies that are more like art house films. One of my favorite movies is The Fall. I also like horror movies and just weird movies in general.
CCPE-6aeca,2,ASSISTANT,"Well, tell me why do you like art house films?"
CCPE-6aeca,3,USER,I like them because usually there's a lot of symbolism and there's a lot of thought that goes into every scene usually things are there for a reason and put there for purpose unlike your typical action film that doesn't really have that.
CCPE-6aeca,4,ASSISTANT,"cool, what was your favorite movie again?"
CCPE-6aeca,5,USER,The Fall.
CCPE-6aeca,6,ASSISTANT,"alright, Why is that your favorite movie"
CCPE-6aeca,7,USER,"Because I love the cinematography. It's beautifully filmed. It was filmed, I think in over 20 countries. It was filmed by a director called Tarsem Singh, if I say his name right. And I believe he financed most of it. It was sort of his pet project, and I like the story. But it's just beautifully"
CCPE-6aeca,8,USER,"A particular movie, I can't think off the top of my head, but in general I'm not a huge fan of comedies. Well, actually I can think of one. I don't really care for like Superbad or movies like that."

CCPE-6aeca,10,ASSISTANT,"oh, Why not?"

CCPE-6aeca,13,USER,I did see that movie.
CCPE-6aeca,14,ASSISTANT,What is it about this kind of movies that you like or dislike?
CCPE-6aeca,15,USER,"The Martian was a little slow, I will have to say. It wasn't terrible or anything. I like sci-fi movies, but it was just slow. It got a little boring in parts. If I was going to pick a sci-fi movie that came out around that same time period, I would've picked Interstellar. I think it had a better story and more meaning. And just was more interesting"
CCPE-6aeca,16,USER,"Although, I believe the motion was more to the book and not necessarily I wouldn't say to the book, but to how it would surely be to be stuck up on more by yourself eventually."
CCPE-6aeca,17,ASSISTANT,Wonderful. thank you for sharing. Good bye.

CCPE-12a08,11,ASSISTANT,what did you dislike about it?
CCPE-12a08,12,USER,"What I disliked about Venom was they made it a PG-13 movie when it should've been rated R. Because Venom is like the antihero. And he's he should be one that doesn't care about anything. Like he he likes to kill, and he likes to do other things. But they toned that down a lot from what everybody was expecting it to be when they first dropped the teaser trailer."

CCPE-42ee0,8,USER,"Well, even though there was almost there wasn't really hardly any actual dialog the movie kept you interested. It had some very great acting in it, and it kept you on to just see what was going to happen at the end. It wasn't a typical ending."
CCPE-42ee0,9,ASSISTANT,it was a twist ending?
CCPE-42ee0,10,USER,"Yes, it was unexpected"
CCPE-42ee0,11,ASSISTANT,Do you like movies like The Matrix?
CCPE-42ee0,12,USER,"Yeah, I do. I like The Matrix. It's keeps you on suspense, and it's kind of out there. It's a different kind of movie."
CCPE-42ee0,13,ASSISTANT,okay. what about movies like Despicable Me?
CCPE-42ee0,14,USER,"I like them. They're cute. It's a good family movie, as long as you know they're not very young. And it's humorous."

CCPE-87d59,1,USER,I like war movies.
CCPE-87d59,2,ASSISTANT,what do you like about war movies?
CCPE-87d59,3,USER,"I like that they depict an otherwise taboo subject, like I know that Hollywood and movies in general are a bit exaggerated and they are not necessary factually correct, but they give people like me who have never seen anything like war a glimpse into what war could or does look like."
CCPE-87d59,4,USER,I think that's pretty cool.
CCPE-87d59,5,ASSISTANT,Can you name a particular war movie you like?
CCPE-87d59,6,USER,Saving Private Ryan is a good one.

CCPE-87d59,10,ASSISTANT,How come you did not like Killer Bongs from Outer Space?
CCPE-87d59,11,USER,"Well, it was a very very cheesy B you know B list movie or whatever it's called and I mean like, I get that that was kinda the point, but it was just so bad it was it was hard to stomach."

CCPE-87d59,15,USER,"I think I watched it, I don't remember much about it. I don't think I minded it, but I didn't like like it enough to watch the sequels, so it's just kind of meh."
CCPE-87d59,16,ASSISTANT,that's alright. The first one was probably the only good one anyways
CCPE-87d59,17,USER,Yeah.
CCPE-87d59,18,ASSISTANT,How do you feel about sci fy movies?
CCPE-87d59,19,USER,"It depends how atrocious it was, so I'd say that they are not too bad. I mean, I'm sure that probably some more serious ones might be good."

CCPE-2cec4,0,ASSISTANT,What type of movies are you interested in?
CCPE-2cec4,1,ASSISTANT,Are there any specific titles that you like in this genre?
CCPE-2cec4,2,USER,"Oh sure. Matrix, Alien series, Blade Runner, those are probably the three classics or my favorite in the genre."
CCPE-2cec4,3,ASSISTANT,"A lot of people do regard these movies as classics, what did you find interesting about them?"
CCPE-2cec4,4,USER,Well visually they're ground breaking. Many movies try to copy them either in style or either in
CCPE-2cec4,5,USER,"The vision that they they show of the future. The stories are usually pretty simple, so So you really And it's about like world building, and you get You lose yourself in the time period or the world that they've created."
CCPE-2cec4,6,ASSISTANT,You enjoy the creativity of them as well as the writing and narrative?
CCPE-2cec4,7,USER,"Yes, maybe more so than the narrative and the writing. Like usually, the narrative or writing is pretty simple, and and they let you just kind of be enveloped by the the art design and the and the setting of the and the world building that they've created."
CCPE-2cec4,8,ASSISTANT,So you like the feeling of immersion into the worlds they have created?
CCPE-2cec4,9,USER,"Absolutely, I think that's the main reason that there's they are considered classics is where they do those that that type of world building better than others. Plus I think that's why people like science fiction is it's kind of like exploring or and it putting yourselves in a whole different place that you can't access in the real world."
CCPE-2cec4,10,ASSISTANT,"I can see why that is appealing, some people would consider those titles as a blueprint for successful science fiction films"
CCPE-2cec4,11,USER,And I think that's true that's why often times the most copied
CCPE-2cec4,12,USER,by other films
CCPE-2cec4,13,ASSISTANT,Are there any specific movie types that you don't like?
CCPE-2cec4,14,USER,"Movie types, I don't like I guess bad versions of"
CCPE-2cec4,15,USER,"in a genre like like superhero movies, I like in general, but you know, there's bad ones like Suicide Squad or Spider-Man 3, where it just kind of goes off the rails and and kind of You almost They almost make you question if you like those type of movies anymore."
CCPE-2cec4,16,ASSISTANT,What did you not like particularly about those two films?
CCPE-2cec4,17,USER,"just throw them in there at last minute and kind of took away And not to mention the whole stuff with Peter Parker going dark and the famous scene of him dancing and stuff. It just seems kind of goes too far to being All those early Spider-Man movies are very campy, but that goes a little bit too far. And then Suicide Squad is just a mess. It doesn't narratively, character-wise, it just There's"
CCPE-2cec4,18,USER,"There's like four beginnings I think to that movie where they introduce the characters like three or four different times, and then there's too many characters, and the story's not very good, so it's just not very good."
CCPE-2cec4,19,USER,"Yes, and it was a good version of the DC movies. Movies like Suicide Squad, they struggle. I think they kind of fall into that Spider-Man thing where they throw too much at you or into their movies, and the tone is very dark, but Wonder Woman was not that. It was very kind of felt like a Marvel movie a little bit. Had a little optimism to it."
CCPE-2cec4,20,ASSISTANT,Thank you for that
CCPE-2cec4,21,USER,Mhm.
CCPE-2cec4,22,ASSISTANT,Goodbye

CCPE-851e3,4,ASSISTANT,what makes you enjoy those films ?
CCPE-851e3,5,USER,"So, all those films have great casts. You know, teen films can be hard cos they are obviously casting younger talent, but they actually a lot of the teen firms are like have gone on to be like good actors later on. So, they are they are good choices, they are just younger before they are becoming sort of a bigger superstars. The other things about those are like 10 things I hate about you and She's the man is that those were series of movies that actually were based on Shakespeare novels, and so it's actually very clever retelling of the stories that really sort of stretched the bounds of what usually teen movie is, so it make the teen movie a little bit more complex, a little more interesting while still being funny and enjoyable so great combination."

CCPE-851e3,9,USER,"It felt like we were fooled. They kind of built this sort of, like, a light-hearted sort of a comedy drama with a good cast and it was anything but. It was, I mean, outside of it just being a complete and utter mess from a story line and writing stand point, despite being based on a book."
CCPE-851e3,10,USER,It was It honestly had aspects of a thriller in it. It was such a bad movie. And it was so far away from what they acted as if it was going to be going in. It's not even funny. Literally one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life.

First time it's really ever been done and I love comedies, I love romantic comedies, so it's a good combination and I'm interested in seeing a nice diverse portrayal in the movie. And it just seems And it Listen, overall it just seems funny."
CCPE-851e3,18,USER,"The cast is great. I love the woman, the lead woman from her other projects. So, I have nothing but high hopes for that one."
